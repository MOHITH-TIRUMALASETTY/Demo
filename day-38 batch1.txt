#JAVA OOP

	Object Oriented Programming - Class Object Inheritance Polymorphism Encapsulation Abstraction
		

#Class Object

		OBJECT - what we find in real life.
                       - every object have attribute and action
                       - tangible  - pen obj
                         non tangible  - account


		CLASS -  It is a blue print of an object


					       Attribute				action
 
			PenObject         color , cost , brand			        write




		instance variable                                  				   Local variable
		- any variable defined inside class outside method			- any variable declared inside method.
                - instance variable have default value 
			String  null
			float  0.0f
			


          class  Pen {


		String color;   // instance variable
		float cost;
		String brand;
                String companyName;

		void write(){

                    int  a=3;   // local variable

		}

		public static void main(String args[]){
			
			Pen obj =  new  Pen();
			obj.write();
			System.out.println("color"+obj.color+"cost:"+obj.cost+"brand:"+obj.brand);

        HandsOn- (Hello World using java)
	   1.Identify 3 object, 5 attribute , 5 action
	   2.Create  3 class
	   3.Create object and print all the attribute value and call the function.

#UML

-Use Case Diagram:
	UML or Unified Modeling Language, is a standardized, general-purpose visual modeling language designed for specifying, visualizing, 
        constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems.



Actor :  who is doing the task ?

     Assessment system : 

		Employee 

		Admin

                instructor


Use Case : Task done by the actor
     
   Employee :   SubmitAssessment  Login  SignUp

   Admin :   ScheduleExam

   Instructor:  CheckAnswer


HandsOn:
	1. Design your project with Actor and UseCase:

		min  3 actor
		min  20 usecase


Software Design
#SDLC -  3/4 months
#AGILE -  2-4 week


#definition
- it is an iterative and incremental model.
- iterative - same process is repeating again and again.ie getting the requirement , design , coding again same process again and again.
		
		design v1 => customer   rejected 
                design v2 => customer   rejected
                design v3 => customer   rejected 
                design v4 => customer   accepted
  
- incremental - we have implemented some features in the beginning and keep on adding new features with the existing software.

                0  1   1   2   3   5   8

#agile principle             
- customer no need to wait until all the features is done.
- we release 10 features in each release.
- we can accommodate the requirement from the customer.



#communication
- good communication between  customer ,  dev ,  tester , business analyst.
  


#Advanteges
- requirement changes are allowed in any stage of development
- in agile delivery is faster.

         devteam(4) =>  2 features => 10 hr =>  completed
         QA(3)    =>  2 features => 6 hr =>  completed

          Standup meeting => 1 features 

         devteam(4) =>  1 features => 4 hr =>  
         QA(3)    =>  1 features => 3 hr => 


          Standup meeting => update features 

         devteam(4) =>  update features => 3 hr =>  
         QA(3)    =>  update features => 2 hr => 


#disadvantage
- less focus on design and documentation but more number of meetings.
 

#SCRUM
-agile is a process model.(that is the process)
-scrum(how to follow the process) is a framework through which we develop the software and release the software.
-to follow the agile principle we follow the scrum framework.


#SCRUM Team
- normally contain 5-9 people. 
- like product owner , scrum master , dev team , QA team

- product owner - define the features of the product
                - always connect with the customer
                - priority on the features according to the market value
                - adjust features and priority every iteration
                - accept or reject work result.
                - separate designation
               
- scrum master - different role
               - facilitate and drive the agile process
               - he make sure that people in the team follow the agile process or not.                       
               
- dev - design and develop software
- QA - test the software

#SCRUM terminology


User Story - feature or module in software


Epic - collection of user stories


Product backlog -  it is a doc or excel contain list of user stories. prepared by product owner


sprint/iteration - period of time to complete user stories.(develop, design, test etc)
                 - min 2 week and max 4 week


sprint planning meeting : meeting in the team and decided what are the features and created 
                   , developed and  delivered to customer.



Spring backlog - list of committed stories by dev/QA for specific sprint.

               - for every sprint the Spring backlog will change.


Scrum meeting - Meeting conducted by scrum master every day 15 min.
              - called as scrum call/Standing meeting.
                      3 questions:
			- what did you do yesterday ?	
			- what will you do today ?
			- are there any impediments in your way ?



Sprint retrospective meeting -  end of the spring one meeting
                            -   what went wrong , what went right, any other thing you want to do next ?


Story Point - during sprint planning meeting  every dev and tester will identify some stories.
            - estimation is done in the form of story point.
            - ex dev say they need some time to develop the sprint, tester say they need some time to define testcase the sprint


 Ex  1 story point =  1 hr  / 1 day  depends on company

     search  is story point -   dev - 5 hr  /  QA - 3 hr 


Burndown chart - graph created by scrum master
               - mainly display how much task remaining in the sprint.

#Bean class
	- any class that have instance variable and its getters and setters is called Bean class.
        - why ?
		- it is used to initialize object attribute.
                - To implement data hiding.
                       - private variable can not be accessed outside object.

	 //Data Hiding : 
                     - hiding attribute value and method inside the object.
                     - data hiding is done using private access specifier.
                      - implemented into two level:
                                       A. data member
                                        B. method level

			obj.setDeptName("Admin");
			System.out.println(obj.getDeptId()+"/"+obj.getDeptName());

#static 
	- How we can access instance variable value from class ?

			answer  :    object

	- Is there any other way to access instance variable value without creating an object of the class ?

			answer : static

	- static is keywork
	- static variable can be accessed using class name if main method is outside the class.
	- static variable value can be accessed without class name if main method is in the same class.
        - static variable value can be shared by multiple object.

	- if we create multiple object , constructor is called multiple time but static block called only one time.
	- first static blocked called then constructor called.

#User Input In Java:
		2 different approach:

			A. Using BufferedReader
			B. Using Scanner



#A. Using BufferedReader

	java.io.

				Stream		StreamReader	     Reader

				Binary            conversion         Character

import java.io.*;
class UserInputDemo{

    public static void main(String args[])throws IOException{
        
            BufferedReader  rd=new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
			System.out.println("Enter your name:");
			String name=rd.readLine();
			System.out.println(name);
            		System.out.println("Enter your marks:");
            		String marks=rd.readLine();
			System.out.println(marks);
    }
}


limitation :
	- we have to handle exception
	- we have to convert binary to character.

#super
	- super is keyword in java.
	- if base class and derived class have same variable name then creating an object of 
	derived class it is not possible to print base class variable vale .
	Base class variable value is hidden inside the Derived class.
        if variable hiding is disease then super is cure.
	- it is used to call base class variable and method.

#UML (5 class)

A UML class diagram is a type of diagram used in software engineering to visually represent the static structure of a system.
 It shows the classes, their attributes, operations (methods), and the relationships between them.
 These diagrams are crucial for object-oriented design and help in modeling the structure and interactions within a software application. 

Key Components of a UML Class Diagram: 
Classes:
Represent the main elements and concepts of the system. They are depicted as rectangles divided into three compartments: name, attributes, and operations.
 
Attributes:
Describe the properties or data of a class. They are listed in the middle compartment of the class rectangle. 

Operations:
Represent the methods or functionalities of a class. They are listed in the bottom compartment of the class rectangle. 

Relationships:
Indicate how classes relate to each other, including inheritance, association, aggregation, and composition.

Agile vs. Waterfall Methodology
How to Write Effective User Stories
Writing Acceptance Criteria for User Stories




		  




Agile Values (from the Agile Manifesto)
1.Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Focus on collaboration and effective communication within teams rather than relying heavily on tools and rigid processes.

2.Working software over comprehensive documentation
Deliver functional products that provide value, rather than spending excessive time creating detailed documentation.

3.Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Engage customers regularly for feedback and alignment, instead of depending solely on contract terms.

4.Responding to change over following a plan
Adapt to evolving needs rather than strictly adhering to initial plans.


























Agile Principles (12 Key Principles)
1.Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery
Deliver valuable software frequently to ensure ongoing customer satisfaction.

2.Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
Embrace change to give customers a competitive advantage.

3.Deliver working software frequently
Release small, functional increments regularly (from weeks to a couple of months).

4.Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
Promote direct and constant collaboration.

5.Build projects around motivated individuals
Support and trust the team to deliver quality outcomes.

6.Face-to-face conversation is the most effective communication method
Prioritize direct interaction for clarity and efficiency (in-person or virtual).

7.Working software is the primary measure of progress
Focus on actual functionality delivered, not just plans or documentation.

8.Sustainable development pace
Ensure the team works at a consistent, maintainable pace.

9.Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
Maintain high-quality code and design standards for agility and scalability.

10.Simplicity—the art of maximizing work not done—is essential
Avoid overcomplicating solutions.

11.Self-organizing teams produce the best architectures, requirements, and designs
Empower teams to make decisions and take ownership.

12.Regular reflection and adjustment
Teams should reflect periodically on their performance and refine processes for improvement.






#Agile vs. Waterfall Methodology: Key Comparison
Agile Methodology						Waterfall Methodology

Iterative and incremental					Linear and sequential

Highly adaptive to changes at any stage				Limited flexibility after the planning phase

All phases (planning, development, testing, etc.) run 
concurrently in short cycles (sprints)				Phases are strictly sequential (requirements → design → implementation → testing → deployment)

Continuous involvement throughout development			Minimal involvement after initial requirements gathering

Frequent small releases of working software			Single, final delivery after the entire project

Continuous feedback and improvement				Feedback usually after project completion

Early detection of issues due to iterative reviews		Risks often identified late in the project




























When to Use Agile:
When requirements are expected to evolve.
For complex projects requiring regular customer feedback.
When rapid delivery of working solutions is important.

When to Use Waterfall:
When requirements are fixed and well-understood.
For regulatory or compliance-driven projects needing detailed documentation.
In environments where scope and deliverables are unlikely to change.




























#How to Write Effective User Stories
A User Story is a short, simple description of a feature or functionality told from the perspective of the end user. 
It focuses on what the user wants to achieve and why, rather than how to build it.


#User Story Format (INVEST Model)
Standard Format:
As a [user role], 
I want [goal or feature] 
so that [benefit or reason].



Example:
As a student, 
I want to receive email reminders for assignment deadlines
so that I can submit on time.

Example:
As a [customer],
i want [shopping cart features]
so that [i can easily purchase items online.]

Example: E-Com
As a manager ,
i want to generate report
so that i can understand which department need more resources.

Example: food delivery system
As a [customer] ,
i want to [receive an SMS ]
so that [i can pick it up right away.]


 
#INVEST Principles:
Independent – Should be self-contained. should not have any dependency on other user story.
Negotiable – Not a strict contract, open for discussion.
Valuable – Delivers clear value to the user.
Estimable – Team should be able to estimate the effort.
Small – Manageable and completable within a sprint.
Testable – Clear enough to validate through testing.(should have necessary info to validate)



#Best Practices for Writing User Stories
Focus on one specific user goal per story.
Avoid technical details; keep it user-focused.
Keep stories concise yet clear.
Ensure the story can be tested and validated.
Collaborate with customers or product owners for clarity.



HandsOn:- Create 5 User Story for your project.



















#Writing Acceptance Criteria for User Stories
Acceptance Criteria define the conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered complete and working as intended.





#Characteristics of Good Acceptance Criteria:
Clear, specific, and measurable.

Testable (can be validated through manual or automated tests).
Focused on user behavior and business rules.
Common Formats for Acceptance Criteria:

1. Given/When/Then Format 
Given [context],
When [action],
Then [expected outcome].


As a student, 
I want to receive email reminders for assignment deadlines
so that I can submit on time.


Example:
Given [that I am logged into my account,]
When [I view my upcoming assignments,]
Then [I should see email reminder status for each assignment.]


2. Bullet Point List Format
Email reminder is sent 24 hours before the deadline.
User can opt in/out of email reminders.
Reminder email contains assignment name and due date.
If deadline is within 24 hours, email is sent immediately.

























Example - Complete User Story with Acceptance Criteria:

User Story:
As a student, I want to receive email reminders for assignment deadlines so that I can submit on time.

Acceptance Criteria:
Given [I am a registered student,]
when [an assignment deadline is within 24 hours,]
then [I should receive a reminder email.]
Email reminders include assignment name and due date.
User can enable/disable reminders from the settings page.




User Story:
As an online shopper, I want to add items to a wishlist so that I can purchase them later.

Acceptance Criteria:
Given [I am logged into my account,] 
when [I click “Add to Wishlist” on a product,] 
then [the product should appear in my wishlist.]
Wishlist items should display the product name, price, and image.
If a product is already in the wishlist, the “Add to Wishlist” button should be disabled or changed to “In Wishlist”.
I should be able to view and manage my wishlist from my account menu.
Removing an item from the wishlist updates the list immediately.



HandsOn: Create 5 acceptance criteria for your project.






#Key Agile Metrics
Agile metrics help teams track progress, predict delivery, and improve performance. 
Two of the most commonly used metrics are Velocity and Burndown Charts.


1. Velocity

What It Measures:
The amount of work (usually in story points) completed by a team in a single sprint.

Why It’s Useful:
Helps in predicting future sprint capacity.
Supports release planning.
Identifies productivity trends.

Example:
If a team completes 40 story points in Sprint 1 and 42 in Sprint 2, their average velocity is 41 points.


2. Burndown Chart

What It Measures:
Shows remaining work versus time within a sprint or project.

How It Works:
X-axis = Time (e.g., sprint days).
Y-axis = Remaining work (story points or tasks).
Line trends downward as tasks are completed.

Why It’s Useful:
Provides a visual representation of sprint progress.


Helps identify scope creep or bottlenecks.
Useful in daily stand-ups and retrospectives.
Types:
Sprint Burndown Chart: Tracks work during a sprint.
Release Burndown Chart: Tracks progress toward a larger release.






1. Need for Maintenance:

Correcting Defects: Fixing bugs or issues discovered after software deployment.

Adapting to Environment Changes: Modifying software to work with new operating systems, databases, browsers, or hardware.

Enhancing Performance: Improving efficiency, response time, or optimizing resource usage.

Adding New Features: Extending the software’s functionality based on evolving business needs.

Ensuring Security: Updating software to protect against emerging security threats.

Legal/Regulatory Compliance: Modifying software to comply with new regulations or standards.




2. Challenges in Software Maintenance

Understanding Legacy Code: Original developers may not be available, and documentation may be outdated.

High Complexity: Interdependencies between modules can make changes risky.

Limited Documentation: Incomplete or outdated documentation increases maintenance difficulty.

Regression Risks: Fixing one issue can unintentionally introduce others.

Resource Constraints: Limited budgets, skilled personnel, or tools for maintenance.

Change Management: Ensuring version control and proper tracking of all changes.




3. Categories of Software Maintenance

Category	Description
Corrective	Fixing defects or errors reported by users post-deployment.
Adaptive	Modifying software to adapt to changes in environment.
Perfective	Enhancing functionalities or performance based on user feedback.
Preventive	Making changes to improve future maintainability and prevent potential problems.

 //OOPs-Polymorphism 
			
			 Every day  how many interaction you do?


				Navin(CEO)                          Max(Student)
				    
				   P					P			
				   W					C
				   C					F
				   D					T
				   C					S
				   C					B
				   



                              OOPs-Polymorphism:

                                    - Same person do different interaction

					Polymer -  C  -   3   Different   State  [C , D, N]

				    - Same function will do different task.
				    - Two types of Polymorphism.
						A. function Overloading or Compile Time Polymorphism
						B. function Overriding or  Runtime Polymorphism











			//Function Overloading  or Compile time Polymorphism
                                 - same function name do different task.
			         - func return type can be different.
				 - based on number of arg and type of arg one of the func 
                                         get selected during compile time.
				



			class   Calculator{
				
				static int   sum(int a,int b){return    a+b;}

				static  float  sum(float a,float b){return a+b;}

				static  float  sum(int a,float b){return  a+b;}


				public static void main(String args[]){

                                                sum(7.0f,9.0f);
				                sum(99,88.0f);
				                sum(17,19);
				}
			}




			//API  Exampple of Compile Time Polymorphism

				System.out.println(23);
				System.out.println("Hello");
				System.out.println(200.00);



                         //Constructor Overloading

				- constructor name is same.

				- based on constructor arg and type of arg one of the constructor
				   get selected during compiletime.



                Overloading /Hands On - 7 : 5 min

				write  a program that use overloaded method for 
				printing different type of array (integer,double,character)









			//Function Overriding
				- same function do different  task
				- inheritance(base class,derived class)
				- when base class and derived class contain same function name
				  with same method signature then   derived class method is overriden 
                                                                             from base class method   with its own code.
                                                                           


			       class    Shape{

				void area(){
				    System.out.println("Inside Shape");
				}

			       }
			        class   Circle extends Shape{

                                     void area(){
				    System.out.println("Calculate Circle  Area");
				     }

			        }
			



                            //Runtime Polymorphism

				-DMD - Dynamic Method Dispatch

				- Always base class ref will point to derived class object.
				 but the reverse is not true.

				 Shape   sh = new   Circle();   correct
				 Circle c = new   Shape();  not correct







				When an overridden method is called through a superclass reference, 
				Java determines which version of the method to call based upon the 
				type of the object being referred to at the time the call occurs.



		               class    Shape{
				void area(){
				    System.out.println("Inside Shape");
				}
			       }

			        class   Circle extends Shape{
                                  void area(){
				    System.out.println("Calculate Circle  Area");
				}
			        }

			        class   MainDemo{

				public static void main(String args[]){
                                       
					Shape   sh = new   Circle();
					sh.area(); 
				}
			        }



                        API  Example Of  Runtime Polymorphism:
                                           toString()



			
			Object class :
				- Any class in Java by default extends another class ie Object class.
				- Module java.base   Package java.lang
				-  11 methods   like toString()
			 







		HandsOn - 8: Runtime Polymorphism

			Create  a base class Fruit which has name ,taste and size as its attributes .
                        A method called eat() is created which describes the name of the fruit and its taste. 
                        Inherit the same in 2 other class Apple and Orange and  override the eat() method
			 to represent each fruit taste.

			final :
			             - It is a   keyword in java.
			             - final class can not be extended.
			             - final data member value can not be changed.
			             - final method can not be overriden.

                                                          Abstraction  -  Expose the functionality to the outside world.

                                                          Data Hiding - hiding the details or function inside the object.


                                                          Encapsulation  =    Abstraction   +  Data Hiding

                                                                 - abstract  is a keyword in java.
                                                                 - abstract keyword before a class name define abstract class.
                                                                 - it has 2 types of method
                                                                              1. Method with definition
                                                                              2. Method with declaration

			           can create an ref of an abstract class.
                                                                 - any class that have abstract method , must be abstract.

                                                               - by default interface variable are public static final.

DevOps : 
           -  It is not a tool or technology 
           -  It is a new culture / process to develop , release and maintainance 
                     of software application/project with higher quality , faster way.

           - we achieve by using automation tools.
                  

               DevOps = developer(plan/code/build/test) +operations(release/deploy/operate/monitor)



#why we need devops ?
                  - required to know existing  sdlc models.
                               -(old model)water fall model(1950-60)
                               -(current model) agile model

                  //Agile model
                  - Most frequently used model .(last 15 years)
                  - It is the combination of multiple sub model
                                 - Rational Unify Model (Rup)
                                 - Adaptive Software Development(ASD)
                                 - crystal clear
                                 - scrum
                  - scrum is the most popular agile framework
                  - continuous delivery
                  - continuous feedback
                  - requirements changes in the model
                  - less development time
                  - less development cost
                  - client satisfaction is very high


                  Why we need to go with devops ?  

                 - devops and agile both are different model.

                 - both the model support rapid software development
                 - the different between both the model come after development.
                 
                                         DevOps                     development   +  operation  

                                         agile                      development   +  no operations




                 - in agile model separate team is responsible for separate task
                                                                      like dev , test , deployment etc
                 - devops person is responsible for all the task from dev to operations.
                 - agile does not force automation  but devops is completely based  on automation.

                 - agile     --->  speed --
                 - devops  ---> quality + speed 




                  //DevOps 
                   - it is a new culture or process
                   - it is the process of continuous development , continuous 
                          build , continuous test , continuous release of software etc.
                   - devops is automation tools.
          

                    what are the main tools we need to know to be devops engineer ?

                      1. version control system
                      2. build tools
                      3. configuration management tool etc





                     //version control system
                                     /software configuration management
                                                          /Source Code management

                    -  need of VCS
                    -  How VCS work ?
                    -  Benefit of VCS
                    -  Types of VCS
                    -  Difference between centralized and distributed VCS

                    // Need of VCS
                    - project module completed and demo done to client
                    - client suggested some changes
                    - project module updated and demo done to client
                    - client suggested some changes
                    - project module updated and demo done to client


                    - every version should be maintained.
                    - but maintaining multiple version is difficult task.
                    
                   Dev1  -->  abc.java
                   Dev2  ---> abc.java  

                   - to maintain different version of code we need VCS.
                   - override of the code should not happen.
                   - developer have share their code to peer developer
                     so that multiple developer will work in collaborated way.
                   - parallel development must be required.
                   - to manage our code , such type of source code management system is version control system.











------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              

//How VCS work ?
                  - we will follow a tool to manage the version.
                  - it is not only for code 
                  - any document if i want to maintain multiple version  
                          tester  >>
                          developer >>
                          Project Manager >>
                  
                   - [work space ]  - used to write code.
                                    - maintain multiple file

                   - [repository] - VCS is applicable
                                  - maintain multiple file

                   - developer save all the files in the repository.
                   - in repository all the data is stored as commit
                      and one unique number is generated for each commit ie version1

                   - commit - sending data from ws to repo

                   - after demo to client
                   - again  all the data is stored as commit
                      and one unique number is generated for each commit ie version2

                    - each details about the commit is stored.
                    - so each commit version we can deliver demo to  client  from repository.

                     - checkout - the process of sending file from 
                                             repository to workspace.

                    - we need a mechanism to do the process.
                                      ie Version Control System.
                    





------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   //Benefit of VCS
                   - we have different version and we can choose any 
                     version based on client requirement.
                   - with every version we can maintain metadata about code.
                   - multiple developer can work in collaborate way
                   - dev can share the code to the peer developer
                   - we can make access control ie who can update code or who can modify code.
 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
         // Types of VCS

                   1. Central Repository Server
                                 - version control happen only in one place.
                                 - all the operations happen in Central Repository
                                 - easy to setup and easy to maintain
                                 ie  CVS , SVN , Perforce

		                         Central Repository Server
                                               commit
               [ Work Space]   --------------->  [   v1 , v2 ,  v3 , v4  ]
                                              <---------------
		                   checkout

                                              commit
               [ Work Space]    -------------->
                                               <---------------
		                 checkout

		                commit
               [ Work Space]   --------------->
                                              <-----------------
		               checkout

                                             commit
                [ Work Space]   --------------->
		        <-------------------
		       checkout




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Limitation of Centralized VCS

          -  The total code stored at a single place ,  some thing wrong cause single point of failure.

          -  All the dev should be connected with the centralized version  control system.
             if network down , version control won't be available to dev.

          -  All checkout and commit operations performed over network.
             low performance.

          - as  the number of file increase then for huge project  this centralized VCS have multiple problems.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       2. Distributed VCS
	- here all workspace have a local repository.
                   - all the versions are maintained in the local repository
                   - even network down then also repository available.
                   - all commit and check out is performed in the local repository
                   - no ques of single point of failure.








	How multiple dev will  work in collaboration ?
                         - all the changes from WS1 will marge into WS4
                         - push and pull operation between two dev - network required
                         - checkout and commit operation - network not required

                                                                                   push
                      WS1[Files,Repository]                     ---->                    WS4[Files,Repository]
                                                                <-----
                                                                                      pull
                      WS2[Files,Repository]                                                 WS5[Files,Repository]
                      WS3[Files,Repository]                                                 WS6[Files,Repository]


          Which tool follow this model  ?
                             1. GIT , Fossil  etc















 //Distributed VCS with Remote Repository:
                        -  it is used to share our code to peer developer.


                                                            

                                          Centralized Repository          local  Repository
                 dev  repository -                 only one                multiple repo
       


                                                                   
//GIT  
               - It is  a Distributed Version Control Tool
               -  Linux  -  Created by Linux Torvalds 
               -  GIT   - created by  Linux Torvalds 
               - no single point of failure since all the dev have local repository.
               - check out and commit performed locally.
               - dev work space not required to connect to network
               - staging area (it is part of developer machine)
                               -  In git  commit is 2 step process
                               -  first   we have to commit in the staging area 
                               - then from staging area to local repository
                               - staging area is a virtual area
                               - we can double check any update before commit
                               - it is not available in the other version of the VCS


                                         WS1[Files]   -------commit--->         [local repository]

                  GIT         -          WS1[Files]   ---------commit -------     [Staging Area]         --commit--->    [local repository]

                            
                  -  git will take the snap shot of the data and then store it
                  -  cryptographic conversion done in the staging area
                  -  convert our data into hashing algo and encrypted format  
                  -  encryption and decryption is automatically take care of by git
                  -  Branching and Merging

                 - we write jS inside the <head>
- <body> - visual area of the page.


- Version	Official Name
  ES5	        ECMAScript 5 (2009)
  ES6	        ECMAScript 2015
	        ECMAScript 2016
	        ECMAScript 2017

The JavaScript naming convention started with ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5 and ES6.
But, ECMAScript 2016 and 2017 was not called ES7 and ES8.
Since 2016 new versions are named by year (ECMAScript 2016 / 2017 / 2018).





//What JavaScript implementations are available?

The first ever JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape, 
and has since been updated to conform to ECMA-262 Edition 5 and later versions.
This engine, code named SpiderMonkey, is implemented in C/C++. 


The Rhino engine, created primarily by Norris Boyd (also at Netscape) 
is a JavaScript implementation written in Java. 
Like SpiderMonkey, Rhino is ECMA-262 Edition 5 compliant.


ECMA-262 5.1 edition, June 2011.
ECMA-262, 6th edition, June 2015.
ECMA-262, 7th edition, June 2016.
ECMA-262, 8th edition, June 2017.
ECMA-262, 9th edition, June 2018.
ECMA-262, 10th edition, June 2019.
ECMA-262, 11th edition, June 2020

Several major runtime optimizations such as TraceMonkey (Firefox 3.5), JägerMonkey (Firefox 4)

Google's V8, which is used in the Google Chrome browser

The Chakra engine used in Internet Explorer 
(although the language it implements is formally called "JScript")














- window is class that represent browser.
- document is object that represent page.
- inside window we can have multiple object ex document


- we can write html inside java script.
- html files are like exe files.we have to use
  <script> to include Js inside html.




hello.html

<head>
<script src="myjs.js">
</script>

<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  document.write("Welcome  to  JS");
<script>


- JS can be written in common area or in a block
- block is more powerful than common area.


- in realtime we use external java script.






- in scripting variable is implicit.
         - during runtime interpreter try to understand 
            what you have declared.
         - what data type it is based on the data.
- in programming language variable is explicit.
         - programmer must declare the int , float type.


//variable creation features
  - variable should start with alphabet
  - variable should not contain special character
  - variable are case sensitive.
  - variable start with var.


			int  a = 10   // java  //explicit


		        var  b = "hello" // java script //implicit



//data types
        primitive (int,float,string,boolean,undefined,null)
        non primitive datatypes(object)

<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  var x = 60;

  document.write("the value is"+x+"<br/>");

  var y = 'Hello';
  document.write("the str is"+y+"<br/>");

  '  ' inside  '  ' - not allowed
  " " inside  " " - not allowed











<noscript>
    - sometimes we are confused weather browser
      does not support JS or we have some error 
      in the JS code.
     - crome by default support Java Script
     - mozila by default support Java Script
     - IE by default support VB Script

-function
      - code reusability
      - A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program. 
        This eliminates the need of writing the same code again and again. 
	It helps programmers in writing modular codes. 
	Functions allow a programmer to divide a big program into a number of small and 
        manageable functions.
      
Ex- function without argument
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">

function MyWarnings()
{
    alert("welcome to JS");
}

</script>
</head>
<body>
<button onclick="MyWarnings()">Click Warnings</button>

</script>
</head>
<body>
<button onclick="display()">Click Warnings</button>
</body>

-document is related to body.as it is visual



==================================================
Hands On:
- call a add or mul method recursive way using java Script from 1 to n.

function add(number) {
  if (number <= 0) {
    return 0;
  } else {
    return number + add(number - 1);
  }
}

document.write(add(4)); 

==================================================
Event-
What is an Event ?
JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser
manipulates a page.
When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. 
Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.


click - happened when user click link or form.
focus - happened when input focus is given to input element.
onload - happened when an object has been loaded.
mouseover - happened when the user moves the mouse pointer.
mouseout - happened when the user moves the pointer off.
select - happened when the user select form element.
submit - when the form is submitted
unload - happened when the user unload the page.


Ex-1
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
function display()
{
alert("Welcome To Events")
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
<button onclick="display()">Click Warnings</button>
</body>



Ex-2
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
function display()
{
    document.getElementById("dd").innerHTML=Date()
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
<p id="dd">Click the button to display date</p>
<button onclick="display()">Click Here</button>
</body>


Ex-3
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
function pageload()
{
alert("page loaded successfully")
}
</script>
</head>
<body onload="pageload()">
<h1> refresh the page to check it</h1>
</body>

Ex-4
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
function imageload()
{
alert("image loaded successfully")
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
<p> once image loaded , message will be displayed</p>
<img src="myimage.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" onload="imageload()"/>
</body>

- onload will execute only when the particular element loaded.



//Big Arrow (Fat Arrow) Functions==Lambda Expression
Before this new standard, JavaScript used the function keyword to create functions. 
Now, we can use the big arrow, =>, to write functions.

/pre ES-6
function add(num1, num2) {
 return num1 + num2;
}


function add(num1, num2) {
 return num1 + num2;
}

function (num1, num2) {
 return num1 + num2;
}

(num1, num2) {
 return num1 + num2;
}

(num1, num2) => num1 + num2;



function mul(num1, num2) {
 return num1 * num2;
}


(num1, num2) => num1 * num2;



 
/ES6 (implicit return)
const addImplicit = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;
 
console.log(add(3, 4));
console.log(addImplicit(3, 4));

#ADM


1. Need for Maintenance:

Correcting Defects: Fixing bugs or issues discovered after software deployment.

Adapting to Environment Changes: Modifying software to work with new operating systems, databases, browsers, or hardware.

Enhancing Performance: Improving efficiency, response time, or optimizing resource usage.

Adding New Features: Extending the software’s functionality based on evolving business needs.

Ensuring Security: Updating software to protect against emerging security threats.

Legal/Regulatory Compliance: Modifying software to comply with new regulations or standards.



2. Challenges in Software Maintenance

Understanding Legacy Code: Original developers may not be available, and documentation may be outdated.

High Complexity: Interdependencies between modules can make changes risky.

Limited Documentation: Incomplete or outdated documentation increases maintenance difficulty.

Regression Risks: Fixing one issue can unintentionally introduce others.

Resource Constraints: Limited budgets, skilled personnel, or tools for maintenance.

Change Management: Ensuring version control and proper tracking of all changes.


3. Categories of Software Maintenance

Category	Description
Corrective	Fixing defects or errors reported by users post-deployment.
Adaptive	Modifying software to adapt to changes in environment.
Perfective	Enhancing functionalities or performance based on user feedback.
Preventive	Making changes to improve future maintainability and prevent potential problems.







Reporting Progress in Agile Projects typically focuses on transparency, collaboration,
 and value delivery over rigid documentation. Instead of traditional progress reports, Agile uses lightweight, iterative techniques. Here's an overview of how progress is reported in Agile projects:


1. Daily Stand-ups (Daily Scrum)
Frequency: Dail
Purpose: Quick updates by each team member:
What was done yesterday?
What will be done today?
Any blockers or impediments?

2. Sprint Reviews
Frequency: At the end of each sprint
Purpose: Demonstrate completed work (potentially shippable product increment) to stakeholders for feedback.
Outcome: Agreement on what’s complete, discussion on next priorities.

3. Burndown Charts / Burnup Charts
Burndown: Tracks remaining work over time.
Burnup: Shows completed work towards total scope.
Benefit: Visual, simple way to track sprint or release progress.

4. Velocity Tracking
Measures the amount of work (usually in story points) completed per sprint.
Helps forecast future sprint capacity and release planning.

5. Cumulative Flow Diagrams
Visualizes the flow of work through stages (To Do, In Progress, Done).
Identifies bottlenecks or work pile-ups.

6. Sprint Goals Achievement
Progress reported against pre-defined sprint goals, not just task completion.

7. Product Backlog Refinement
Continuous visibility of prioritized items.
Reporting can focus on how backlog is evolving based on customer feedback and team capacity.


8. Team Demos
Short demos after completing significant features or increments, outside of formal sprint reviews.


9. Agile Project Dashboards (Tool-Based Reporting)
Tools like Jira, Azure DevOps, Rally, or Trello provide real-time dashboards.
Common metrics:
Number of stories completed
Remaining backlog items
Sprint progress
Team capacity/utilization





#WebApplication using Servlet/jsp  (J2EE)


- 3 tier architecture

     Web Component - simple web application using (servlet and jsp )
                   

     Application component - Enterprise level Application (springbc,adfbc,ejb)
                                 - distributed
                                 - persistence

     Enterprise level Application - cloud - (springbc,adfbc,ejb)




-  Application Server  = >    Cloud  



#cloud

#introduction:
today  every one leverage this cloud computing.
regardless of job role , industry need employees to do cloud computing.


#what is cloud computing ?
- to run car we need electricity , gas
- to run a web application we need server to run.
- to run our home we need power.
- we don't create power grid ? we connect our home , car with the power grid and consume the power from the grid.  then we pay the bill at the end of the month.


- How servers are related to cloud computing ?
- same like power company , gcp , aws , azure they supply the resource , server  to the IT company.
- we connect the internet to setup the servers and it resources. 


- Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet, including data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software
- cloud computing will give you compute resources based on the demand that you have.
- based on the use of those cloud computing resources you are liable to pay the bill to the cloud provider.




#Evaluation of cloud computing 
- any org main their infostructure , they maintain the hardware , 
above hardware they install os , and above os they  run the application.
 like this way they main 3 diff server pro production , dev and testing.


limitation  - as the applications are growing , as the need of the customer growing , they need 
                  more servers and hardware infostructure.



- this problem solved by Virtualization.  
same hardware but they can create multiple VM above it using  Virtualization.
- each virtual machine can be used as Dev , Prod or testing env or database instance etc.
limitation - they have to maintain their own hardware , 24hr power supply , if more traffic they have to increase the hardware.


- to resolve the problems cloud computing come into picture.
- initially organization provide db server , as server as the resource provider.
- like this way it company buy the server , db , storage from the cloud provider. when company don't need the same 
  they simply delete the server or db or storage.
- initially cloud provider supply very minimul services like linux server or windows server or db.


- today cloud provider providing lots of services
   like  - unlimited storage , compute , analytics , iot , ml etc
- it company today can use these products just plugins and play. any where , any time and of any size.

HandsOn - bootstrap(6) , GIT(6) 








JS  Global Function
- pre predefined function
- define in any level

ie  eval()


Ex-1
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
var  a = prompt("Enter any number","");
alert(eval(x));
alert("execution done")
</script>
</head>
<body>
</body>


Ex-2

<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
document.write(isFinite(105))
</script>
</head>
<body>
</body>

Ex-3
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
document.write(isNaN(105))
</script>
</head>
<body>
</body>

Ex-4
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
var  x = "400";
var y = 500;
var z = parseInt(x)+y;
document.write("sum="+z)

</script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
================================================    


//Error in JS


                try{

		var x= 200;
		document.writ("x="+x);

		}catch()


























The try statement lets you test a block of code for errors.
The catch statement lets you handle the error.
The throw statement lets you create custom errors.
The finally statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.


1. Syntax error - parsing  occur during compilation
                             - total statement
2. Runtime error - exception occur during runtime
                                - part of the statement


ex-1
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">

document.write("Welcome')  //syntax error
document.wri("Welcome") //runtime error

</script>
</head>
<body>
</body>









The Error Object
JavaScript has a built in error object that provides error information when an error occurs.
The error object provides two useful properties: name and message.

finally- two different case

	        some of the statement we can write inside a try block but it is possible
		that JS Engine may avoid the execution of those line of code.

		case-1   we have written statement where the previous line throw error then
                         this line can never be executed.
		case-2   it is possible that JS Engine may avoid the execution of non-js object.
  
                       
			  
ex-2
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
try{
      alert("welcome To JS");
      ale("welcome to Exception");
      alert("finally block");
}catch(e)
{
       alert(e.description)
       alert(e.message)
       alert(e.name)
}
finally{
       alert("finally block")
}

</script>
</head>
<body>

Six different values can be returned by the error name property:

Error Name	Description
EvalError	An error has occurred in the eval() function
RangeError	A number "out of range" has occurred
ReferenceError	An illegal reference has occurred
SyntaxError	A syntax error has occurred
TypeError	A type error has occurred
URIError	An error in encodeURI() has occurred



Range Error
A RangeError is thrown if you use a number that is outside the range of legal values.
For example: You cannot set the number of significant digits of a number to 500.

var num = 1;
try {
  num.toPrecision();  
}
catch(err) {
  document.write(err.name);
}




Reference Error
A ReferenceError is thrown if you use (reference) a variable that has not been declared:

var x = 5;
try {
  x = y + 1;   // y cannot be used (referenced)
}
catch(err) {
  document.write(err.name);
}


Syntax Error
A SyntaxError is thrown if you try to evaluate code with a syntax error.

try {
  eval("alert('Hello)"); 
}
catch(err) {
  document.write(err.name);
}


Type Error
A TypeError is thrown if you use a value that is outside the range of expected types:

var num = 1;
try {
  num.toUpperCase();   // You cannot convert a number to upper case
}
catch(err) {
  document.write(err.name);
}




URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) Error
A URIError is thrown if you use illegal characters in a URI function:
try {
  decodeURI("%%%");   // You cannot URI decode percent signs
}
catch(err) {
  document.write(err.name);
}


=================================================

//throw - It is used to throw User defined Error.


Registration: 

	id   :  [    ]
 
	name  :  [     ]

	age   :  [     ]   age < 25 



The throw statement throws a user-defined exception. Execution of the current function will stop

function getRectArea(width, height) {
  if (isNaN(width) || isNaN(height)) {
    throw 'Parameter is not a number!';
  }
}

try {
  getRectArea(3, 'A');
} catch (e) {
   document.write(e)
  // expected output: "Parameter is not a number!"
}





======================================================
//user defined exception
-creates an object of type UserException and uses it in a throw statement.

function UserException(message) {
  this.message = message;
  this.name = 'UserException';
}

function getMonthName(age) {
  if (age > 25) {
    throw new UserException('InvalidAgeNo');
  }
}

try {
  getMonthName(12)
} catch (e) {
  document.write(e.message, e.name); // pass exception object to err handler
}


=======================================================
Hands On:
Using an error constructor to create an error object, these error objects throw 
an exception when an error occurs during program execution.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<title>Throw Statement with Error constructor</title>
</head>
<body>
<script>
var x = 15, y = 10;
try {
if(x == y)
throw new Error("Both are same value!");
else
throw new Error("Both are different!");
} catch(e) {
document.write(e.message);
}
</script>
</body>
</html>


=======================================================
Object - 
        JavaScript is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language. 
        A programming language can be called object-oriented if it provides four basic capabilities to developers −

       Encapsulation − the capability to store related information, whether data or methods, together in an object.
       Aggregation − the capability to store one object inside another object.
       Inheritance − the capability of a class to rely upon another class (or number of classes) for some of its 
       properties and methods.
       Polymorphism − the capability to write one function or method that works in a variety of different ways.

        -JS is object oriented programming.

        -JS Object
                 Array,Boolean,Date,Math,String,Number,RegExp
        -Browser Object
                  Window , Navigator,Screen,History,Location
        -User Defined Object


==========================================================
Array Object:
-An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.
-Spaces and line breaks are not important. A declaration can span multiple lines:
         

	  var  arr=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']; 

-You can also create an array, and then provide the elements:
                   cars = [];

	           cars[0]= "Saab";
                   cars[1]= "Volvo";
                   cars[2]= "BMW";

- 3 different approach to create array in JS

   1.literals
   2.regular
   3.condensed

ex-1
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">

var  arr=['a','b','c','d'];   //literal
document.write(arr.length)


ex-2
<p id="demo"></p>
<script>

var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars;

document.write(cars.length)
document.write(cars[0])
cars.push("ford")
document.write("<br>")
document.write(cars)
cars[8]="xyz"
document.write("<br>")
document.write(cars) 

var  cc =cars.pop()
document.write(cc)

document.write("<hr>")
--For simplicity, readability and execution speed, use the array literal method.



var  arr1= new Array(); //regular
arr1[0]="a"
arr1[1]="b"
arr1[2]="c"
arr1[3]="d"
arr1[4]="f"
document.write(arr1.length)
-JavaScript has a built in array constructor new Array().



var  arr2= new Array('a','b','c','d');//condensed
document.write(arr1.length)




//The Difference Between Arrays and Objects
-In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes. 
 
Many programming languages support arrays with named indexes.
Arrays with named indexes are called associative arrays (or hashes).
JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes.
In JavaScript, arrays always use numbered indexes.  

var person = [];
person["firstName"] = "John";
person["lastName"] = "Doe";
person["age"] = 46;
document.write(person.length);     
document.write(person[0]);


In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.

//var emp2 = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
//document.write("Emp first name is : " + emp2.firstName + "<br>");
//document.write("Emp last name is : " + emp2.lastName + "<br>");










======================================================
//Date Object
      - new Date() creates a new date object with the current date and time:
      - Date objects are static. The computer time is ticking, but date objects are not.

var d = new Date();
document.write(d)

      - new Date(year, month, ...) creates a new date object with a specified date and time.
      -7 numbers specify year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond (in that order):

d = new Date(2018, 11, 24, 10, 33, 30, 0);
document.write(d)

        - JavaScript Stores Dates as Milliseconds
        - JavaScript stores dates as number of milliseconds since January 01, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC 

var d = new Date(7000000000000);
document.write(d)

         -Date Methods
          When a Date object is created, a number of methods allow you to operate on it.
          Date methods allow you to get and set the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond 
          of date objects, using either local time or UTC
         - The toDateString() method converts a date to a date string:

var d = new Date();
document(d.toDateString());



====================================================
//number object
-JavaScript has only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without decimals.
-JavaScript Numbers are Always 64-bit Floating Point
  Unlike many other programming languages, JavaScript does not define different types of 
   numbers, like integers, short, long, floating-point etc.
-JavaScript numbers are always stored as double precision floating point numbers, following
   the international IEEE 754 standard.

var x = 10;
var y = 20;
var z = x + y;

var x = 123e5;    // 12300000
var y = 123e-5;   // 0.00123

======================================================
//JS Boolean
-A JavaScript Boolean represents one of two values: true or false.

The Boolean() Function
You can use the Boolean() function to find out if an expression (or a variable) is true:

document.write(Boolean(10 > 9))
document.write(10 > 9)


//JS Math
The Math Object
Unlike other objects, the Math object has no constructor.

The Math object is static.
All methods and properties can be used without creating a Math object first.


document.write(Math.E)        // returns Euler's number
document.write("<br>")
document.write(Math.PI)       // returns PI
document.write("<br>")
document.write(Math.SQRT2)    // returns the square root of 2
document.write("<br>")
document.write(Math.SQRT1_2) // returns the square root of 1/2


Math.round(x) returns the nearest integer:  
Math.round(4.6);

Math.ceil()
Math.ceil(x) returns the value of x rounded up to its nearest integer:
document.write(Math.ceil(4.1))       

Math.floor()
Math.floor(x) returns the value of x rounded down to its nearest integer:
document.write(Math.floor(4.1))  

Math.trunc()
Math.trunc(x) returns the integer part of x:

document.write(Math.trunc(4.7)) 
document.write(Math.trunc(4.4))      

Math.pow()
Math.pow(x, y) returns the value of x to the power of y:

Math.sqrt()
Math.sqrt(x) returns the square root of x:

//js string

A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.
You can use single or double quotes:

let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";  // Double quotes
let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';  // Single quotes


You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:
let answer1 = "It's alright";
let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';


String Length
To find the length of a string, use the built-in length property:
let text = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
let length = text.length;


The sequence \"  inserts a double quote in a string:
let text = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";


JavaScript Strings as Objects
Normally, JavaScript strings are primitive values, created from literals:
let x = "John";


But strings can also be defined as objects with the keyword new:
let y = new String("John");

The new keyword complicates the code and slows down execution speed.
String objects can produce unexpected results

=======================================================
//The Window Object

The window object is supported by all browsers. It represents the browser's window.
All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.
Global variables are properties of the window object.
Global functions are methods of the window object.
Even the document object (of the HTML DOM) is a property of the window object:

window.document.write("hello")


//JavaScript Window Screen
The window.screen object contains information about the user's screen.

screen.width
screen.height
screen.availWidth
screen.availHeight
screen.colorDepth
screen.pixelDepth


The screen.width property returns the width of the visitor's screen in pixels.


//JavaScript Window Location

The window.location object can be used to get the current page address 

window.location.href returns the href (URL) of the current page
window.location.hostname returns the domain name of the web host
window.location.pathname returns the path and filename of the current page
window.location.protocol returns the web protocol used (http: or https:)
window.location.assign() loads a new document


window.document.write(window.location.href)

//JavaScript Window Navigator
The window.navigator object contains information about the visitor's browser.

 //User Defined Object

With JavaScript, you can define and create your own objects.
There are different ways to create new objects:
      
      -Create a single object, with the keyword new.
      -Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.
      -Create a single object, using an object literal.
      

- All user-defined objects and built-in objects are descendants of an object called Object.
var employee = new Object();

- A constructor is a function that creates and initializes an object. JavaScript provides a special 
constructor function called Object() to build the object. The return value of the Object() constructor
 is assigned to a variable.

- Create a single object, using an object literal.
   Using an object literal, you both define and create an object in one statement.
   An object literal is a list of name:value pairs (like age:50) inside curly braces {}.

=====================================================
//How JavaScript has changed over the years ?



JavaScript beginnings

The first iteration of JavaScript was actually not called JavaScript at all. 
It was called Mocha. This language was created to be a higher-level language for 
designers and non-programmers alike.

When Mocha was shipped with Netscape Navigator 2.0, its production name became LiveScript, 
and then in later versions, JavaScript.

Netscape was certainly ahead of the game with their collaboration 
with Sun Microsystems in creating JavaScript. As Netscape gained more and more 
of the browser share, other browsers needed to come up with something 
to keep up with Netscape’s success.

JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich, and in 1997 and became an ECMA standard.

Microsoft created their own version of JavaScript, called JScript. 
The main mission of these “dialects” was to increase the user experience 
and user interaction of web sites.
with the creation of JScript, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer was increasing their browser share.

ES3            ECMAScript 3(1999)
ES5	ECMAScript 5 (2009)
ES6	ECMAScript 2015
	ECMAScript 2016
	ECMAScript 2017

The JavaScript naming convention started with ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5 and ES6.
But, ECMAScript 2016 and 2017 was not called ES7 and ES8.
Since 2016 new versions are named by year (ECMAScript 2016 / 2017 / 2018).





#ES3

Strict Equality: Beginning with ES3, the strict equality operator ( === ) became an option to
 use in addition to the equality operator ( == ).
Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
“==” is used to compare values whereas, “ === “ is used to compare  types.
       

var x = 2;
var y = "2";
document.write(x == y)  // Returns true since the value of both x and y is the same
document.write(x === y) // Returns false since the typeof x is "number" and typeof y is "string"



Regular Expressions: Two types of regular expressions became available in ES3: literal and constructor.

Literal Expressions: Literal regular expressions are expressed in between two backslashes.

var str = "This is a Good book";
var patt = /good/i;      # i means case insensitive matching
var result = str.match(patt);
document.write(result)

Constructor Expressions: Constructor regular expressions are those expressions that are created as an 
instance of the RegExp object.

var str = "Hello Studytonight";
var regex = new RegExp('hello');
document.write(regex.test(str)); 


Switch Statement:


Try/Catch Handling:











#ES4   never released due to internal conflict


#ES5 

“use strict”
Prior to ES5, undeclared variables  were allowed to be used. 
When the “use strict” feature is turned on, a reference error is thrown.
Use  ctrl+shift+j   to check error

"use strict"
x = 5
document.write(x)



forEach()
A method that is very similar to a for loop. For every element found in the array, 
the forEach() method executes a callback function on it.

var arr = [6, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7];
 
arr.forEach(function(element) {
 console.log(element * 2);
})






indexOf() and lastIndexOf()
If you need to search for a particular element in an array, you can do 
that with indexOf() and lastIndexOf(). indexOf() returns the first index 
of the search parameter if it’s found, otherwise it returns a -1.

In lastIndexOf(), it gives us the last index of the search element 
in the array. Again, if not found, it’ll return -1.

console.log(arr.indexOf(4)); // 1
console.log(arr.indexOf(2)); // -1
console.log(arr.indexOf(7)); // 4


isArray()
This method checks to see if the object passed to it is an array or not. Returns a boolean.

var str = "Hello All";
console.log(Array.isArray(arr));
console.log(Array.isArray(str));

map() , some()...........


JSON
The ability to parse and stringify JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) 
became a possibility in the ES5 standard. The JSON format is used 
to basically transmit some sort of structured data over a network 
connection, usually a web application and an API.

When we transmit the data from one application, it has to be in the 
form of a string. We use JSON.stringify() to transform JavaScript objects into strings.

We then use JSON.parse() on the other side, to transform the data 
after transmission back to a JavaScript object so we can use it.


var obj = {
 author: "Goven King",
 title: "How hibernate work",
 published: true
}
 
console.log("======== OBJ EXAMPLE ==========");
console.log("orig obj=====>", obj);
console.log("stringified obj=====>", JSON.stringify(obj));
console.log("proof of type=====>", typeof JSON.stringify(obj));
console.log("parsed string=====>", JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)));
console.log("proof of type=====>", typeof JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)), "\n\n");







========================================================

//New Date Methods
There were two new Date object methods that were introduced in ES5
 that are functionally equivalent. They both return the current time in
 milliseconds since January 1, 1970. 
They are Date.now() and new Date().valueOf().

<script type="text/javascript">
             console.log(Date.now());
             console.log(new Date().valueOf());
</script>


//accessors
accessor properties are methods that get or set the value of an object.
For that, we use these two keywords:
get - to define a getter method to get the property value
set - to define a setter method to set the property value

<script type="text/javascript">		
const student = {
    firstName: 'Paromita',
    get name() {
        return this.firstName;
    },
	set name(str){
		this.firstName=str;
	}
};

console.log(student.firstName); 
console.log(student.name);
student.name = 'dola'
console.log(student.firstName); 
console.log(student.name);
</script>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 # ES 6 


//Big Arrow (Fat Arrow) Functions = Lambda Expression
Before this new standard, JavaScript used the function keyword to create functions. 
Now, we can use the big arrow, =>, to write functions.

/pre ES-6
function add(num1, num2) {
 return num1 + num2;
}
 
/ES6 (implicit return)
const addImplicit = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;
 
console.log(add(3, 4));
console.log(addImplicit(3, 4));







//classical inheritance

ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, introduced JavaScript Classes.
JavaScript Classes are templates for JavaScript Objects.

The Constructor Method
The constructor method is a special method:

It has to have the exact name "constructor"
It is executed automatically when a new object is created
It is used to initialize object properties
If you do not define a constructor method, JavaScript will add an empty constructor method.




A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class:

class Car {
  constructor(brand) {
    this.carname = brand;
  }
  present() {
    return 'I have a ' + this.carname;
  }
}

class Model extends Car {
  constructor(brand, mod) {
    super(brand);
    this.model = mod;
  }
  show() {
    return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model;
  }
}



let myCar = new Model("Ford", "Mustang");
document.write(myCar.show())




//JavaScript Static Methods
Static class methods are defined on the class itself.
You cannot call a static method on an object, only on an object class.

class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  static hello() {
    return "Hello!!";
  }
}

let myCar = new Car("Ford");
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = Car.hello();














//let and const



  var a = "Hello"
  a = "Demo"


  let  a = 20;
  let  a = 40;



























Prior to ES2015(ES6), JavaScript supported only function level scoping unlike other languages like C++/Java 
which has block level scoping. 
With ES2015(ES6), in addition to function level scoping, JavaScript also supports block level scoping 
with the help of “let” and “const” keywords.

var keyword where you could redeclare variables with another value.
 This proved problematic when we had the same variable name with different values
 that produced unintended bugs.

// pre-ES6: 
var x = 5;
var x = 120; //produces no errors
console.log(x)

The let keyword can be reassigned as needed. When used in the same scope, 
a redeclaration of the same variable will throw a syntax error

// ES6: 
let x = 5;
//let x = 120; // produces a syntax error in redeclare
x=400          // produces no error in reassign
console.log(x)


The const keyword is useful when you have a variable that you have no intention of reassigning. 
It will throw an error if you try to reassign your const variable to another value.

// ES6: 
const x = 5;
x=400          // produces error in reassign
console.log(x)

------------------------------------------------------------------
keyword	        const           let              var
global scope	no	        no	         yes
function scope	yes	        yes	         yes
block scope	yes	        yes	          no
-----------------------------------------------------------------

ex-1
var variable1 = 23;
let variable2 = 89;
function catchValues(){
  console.log(variable1);
  console.log(variable2);

// Both the variables can be accessed anywhere since they are declared in the global scope
}
window.variable1; // Returns the value 23
window.variable2; // Returns undefined

- Variables that are declared with the var keyword in the global scope are added to the window/global object.
- the variables declared with the let keyword are not added to the global object, 
  therefore, trying to access such variables using window.variableName results in an error.

ex-2

{
  var variable3 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
}
console.log(variable3); // Outputs [1,2,3,4]

{
  let variable4 = [6, 55, -1, 2];
}
console.log(variable4); // Throws error

- Variables declared with var keyword do not have block scope
- Variables declared with let keyword inside the block scope cannot be accessed from outside of the block.





     //Java 


// Rest parameter ( … )(collect inside array)

It provides an improved way of handling parameters of a function.
Using the rest parameter syntax, we can create functions that can take a variable number of arguments.
Any number of arguments will be converted into an array using the rest parameter.
It also helps in extracting all or some parts of the arguments.
Rest parameter can be used by applying three dots (...) before the parameters.
Rest parameter should always be used at the last parameter of a function


function extractingArgs(...args){
  return args[1];
}

document.write(extractingArgs(6, 5, 7, 99));













//Spread operator (…)(iteration)
Although the syntax of spread operator is exactly the same as the rest parameter,
 spread operator is used to spread an array, and object literals


function addFourNumbers(num1,num2,num3,num4){
  return num1 + num2 + num3 + num4;
}

let fourNumbers = [5, 6, 7, 8];
document.write(addFourNumbers(...fourNumbers)); 














/*let array1 = [3, 4, 5, 6];
let clonedArray1 = [...array1];

console.log(clonedArray1); */






let obj1 = {x:'Hello', y:'Bye'};

let obj2 = {z:'Yes', a:'No'};
let mergedObj = {...obj1, ...obj2}; // Spreads both the objects and merges it
console.log(mergedObj);



//template literal
-In ES6, you create a template literal by wrapping your text in backticks (`)
-you can freely use the single or double quotes in the template literal without escaping.
-Variable and expression substitutions
                     At this point, a template literal is just like a better version of a normal JavaScript string. 
                     The big difference between a template literal and a normal string is substitutions.

                     The substitutions allow you to embed variables and expressions in a string. The JavaScript
                     engine will automatically replace these variables and expressions with their values. 
                     This feature is known as string interpolation.



   
	
		
   let firstName = 'John',
    lastName = 'Doe';
    let greeting = `Hi ${firstName}, ${lastName}`;
    console.log(greeting); 

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #ES 7     ECMA  Script  2017

//Array.prototype.includes( )
The .includes( ) method makes it easier for you to check if particular 
values are stored in an array. 
In the past, JavaScript developers had to use indexOf and create a new function. 
But .include( ) will return true if an array includes an element and false if it does not.


let array = [1,3,5,9];
console.log(array.includes(2));
console.log(array.includes(3));


//The exponential operator
The exponential operator simplifies the way we do math in JavaScript. 
In the past, we had to use loop, recursive functions, or Math.pow( ),
 which could get pretty messy with each concatenation

	/old
	console.log(Math.pow(2,2));
                   console.log(Math.pow(2,3));
	
	/new
	console.log(2**2);
                   console.log(2**3);

// async and wait

If you use the async keyword before a function definition,
 you can then use await within the function. 
When you await a promise, the function is paused in a non-blocking way until the promise settles.
 If the promise fulfills, you get the value back. If the promise rejects, the rejected value is thrown.

-ES 2017 introduced Asynchronous functions.
-Async functions are necessarily a cleaner way to work with asynchronous code in JavaScript.
-A promise is an object that may produce a single value sometime in the future: 
   either a resolved value or a reason that it’s not resolved
-A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending.
-Promises are eager, meaning that a promise will start doing whatever task
 you give it as soon as the promise constructor is invoked. 

Async functions in Javascript
The word “async” before a function means one simple thing: 
a function always returns the promise. 
Other values are wrapped in a resolved promise automatically.

Await in Javascript
The keyword await JavaScript to wait until that promise settles and returns its result.


function resolveAfter2Seconds() {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('resolved');
    }, 8000);
  });
}

async function asyncCall() {
  console.log('calling');
  const result = await resolveAfter2Seconds();
  console.log(result);
  // expected output: "resolved"
}

asyncCall();

Adapting to Environment Changes: Modifying software to work with new operating systems, databases, browsers, or hardware.

Enhancing Performance: Improving efficiency, response time, or optimizing resource usage.

Adding New Features: Extending the software’s functionality based on evolving business needs.

Ensuring Security: Updating software to protect against emerging security threats.

Legal/Regulatory Compliance: Modifying software to comply with new regulations or standards.



2. Challenges in Software Maintenance

Understanding Legacy Code: Original developers may not be available, and documentation may be outdated.

High Complexity: Interdependencies between modules can make changes risky.

Limited Documentation: Incomplete or outdated documentation increases maintenance difficulty.

Regression Risks: Fixing one issue can unintentionally introduce others.

Resource Constraints: Limited budgets, skilled personnel, or tools for maintenance.

Change Management: Ensuring version control and proper tracking of all changes.


3. Categories of Software Maintenance

Category	Description
Corrective	Fixing defects or errors reported by users post-deployment.
Adaptive	Modifying software to adapt to changes in environment.
Perfective	Enhancing functionalities or performance based on user feedback.
Preventive	Making changes to improve future maintainability and prevent potential problems.




Reporting Progress in Agile Projects typically focuses on transparency, collaboration,
 and value delivery over rigid documentation. Instead of traditional progress reports, Agile uses lightweight, iterative techniques. Here's an overview of how progress is reported in Agile projects:


1. Daily Stand-ups (Daily Scrum)
Frequency: Dail
Purpose: Quick updates by each team member:
What was done yesterday?
What will be done today?
Any blockers or impediments?

2. Sprint Reviews
Frequency: At the end of each sprint
Purpose: Demonstrate completed work (potentially shippable product increment) to stakeholders for feedback.
Outcome: Agreement on what’s complete, discussion on next priorities.

3. Burndown Charts / Burnup Charts
Burndown: Tracks remaining work over time.
Burnup: Shows completed work towards total scope.
Benefit: Visual, simple way to track sprint or release progress.

4. Velocity Tracking
Measures the amount of work (usually in story points) completed per sprint.
Helps forecast future sprint capacity and release planning.

5. Cumulative Flow Diagrams
Visualizes the flow of work through stages (To Do, In Progress, Done).
Identifies bottlenecks or work pile-ups.

6. Sprint Goals Achievement
Progress reported against pre-defined sprint goals, not just task completion.

7. Product Backlog Refinement
Continuous visibility of prioritized items.
Reporting can focus on how backlog is evolving based on customer feedback and team capacity.


8. Team Demos
Short demos after completing significant features or increments, outside of formal sprint reviews.


9. Agile Project Dashboards (Tool-Based Reporting)
Tools like Jira, Azure DevOps, Rally, or Trello provide real-time dashboards.
Common metrics:
Number of stories completed
Remaining backlog items
Sprint progress
Team capacity/utilization

- what is unix/Linux
   - what is os - simple piece of software which control computer hardware
     resources and manages multiple user program running on it.
   - os is the controller of hardware resources.
   - os control the following
           - keyboard
           - ram
           - cpu
           - usb devices
           - hard disk
   - other os like  windows 11 , Android OS running on phone , VxWorks Embedded missile launcher 



- Unix history
   - Unix originated in MIT , Bell labs and generic electric
   - out of group of developer Ken Thompson and Denis Ritchie modified and rename as Unix.
   - different org developed the Unix based on their need.
   - computer engineer Linus Torvalds created Linux from the base version of unix.


- Unix family of OS
   - from unix multiple OS evolved
                - AIX(created by IBM)
                - Solaris(created by sun)
                - Linux

     Applications
    ==========
     Shell
    ==========
     System call
    ==========
     kernel

 - kernel
   - kernel is the heart of the os or master of os
   - kernel is written in c
   - Linux kernel manages harddisk , mouse , ram , ethernet etc
   - it also manages user process.
   - 
 - System call
   - System call  are the standard call which Query the kernel for specific need.
             - when you write some code , it is sending a system call to kernel and you will get the date.
             - system call access file from disk
             - system call access to packets in the network devices.
             - when you open a browser ie a user process the start of the process is done as system call.
             - when you kill a process , it will go as system call.
  - shell
   - it is the user interface that is used to run command line program or utilities.
   - it is the user interface to the OS.
   - shell call the system call to get the output.
   - type of shell
            bash - bourn again shell, default to centos , ubuntu etc
            ksh - not default to os
            csh - not default to os

- Application
   - application are user program that kernel manage
   - ex database , web server(apache http) , browser





#set up virtual machine

- Oracle VM
     - not required to format your host os.
     - using oracle vm as hypervisor we install unix.
     - we can install any Linux os flavour above oracle VM
     - creation of vm and above it guest os like ubuntu use  the host os resources.
     - download the oracle VM
          https://www.oracle.com/eg/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html

- Using ubuntu iso image

#Linux file system and boot process
     - how Linux os start up ?
     - kernel maintain a file and directory structure.
     - each file and directory is given a unique number called the inode.
     - / is called the root of the file system.
     - under root directories there exist other directories and file.























storage
     - harddisk is defined as file system.
     - filesystem supported by Linux are ext3 , ext4, jfs etc 
     - all unix based os use ext3 and ext4 as default.
     - storage media supported are SCSI disk , USB disk etc
   /> ls    - list directories and file
   /> ls -li - show some other info
   /> ls -li /
  




























File System Directory Structure:

/ - root or parent
/bin - binary executable like bash date
/boot - contain the kernel code image
/dev - device interface files
     - tty are terminal devices. linux kernel identify the terminal are also as devices. 
     - stdin connected with keyboard
     - stdout connected with monior.
/etc - configuration file for system and application
/home - home directory for the user
      - unix support multi user environment
      - every user have their home directory.
/media - usb drive , cd rom are mounted
/var/log - application and system log files
/proc - kernel process file system

/> ls /bin

/> ls /boot    - kernel software is inside

/> ls /dev

/> ls /etc

/> ls /home

/> ls /var/log

/> ls /proc

/> which date - location of the command
/> which pwd  




#boot process

- systematic workflow of the process  which take place '
when Linux machine start.
s-1 system power on
s-2 Power On self Test
s-3 Basic input output system(BIOS) drivers loaded into RAM

Why Logging is Important
Logging is the practice of recording events, actions, and messages 
from applications or systems into files, databases, or monitoring tools.


Importance of Logging:


-Troubleshooting	  Helps diagnose errors or failures quickly
-Understanding Behavior	  Tracks how users and systems behave over time
-Auditing & Compliance	  Keeps historical records for security and audits
-Performance Monitoring	  Identifies bottlenecks or abnormal patterns
-Reproducibility	  Lets you recreate steps that led to an issue
-Alerts & Notifications	  Enables real-time alerts when problems occur



Common Logging Use Cases

Use Case		Description
Application Debugging	Log function entries, variable values, and logic flow
Security 		Audits	Record logins, failed access attempts, privilege escalations
System Monitoring	Track CPU usage, disk I/O, uptime, crash reports
User Activity Logs	Track user actions like logins, data updates, or file uploads
Transaction Logs	Record database or API transaction events
Error Tracking		Capture stack traces, HTTP status codes, and exception messages


Logging Levels Explained
Logging levels help categorize the importance and urgency of log messages.

Level			Use Case				Example

DEBUG			Detailed info for debugging		Variable values, flow tracing
INFO			General app progress			Startup complete, user login
WARNING			Something unexpected, not critical	Deprecated API used, retrying connection
ERROR			An error occurred, but app can continue	Failed database write, missing file
CRITICAL / FATAL  	Very severe error, may crash system	Disk full, app crash, service unavailable



Example (Python-style logging):

import logging

logging.debug("This is a debug message")
logging.info("User login successful")
logging.warning("Low disk space")
logging.error("Failed to save file")
logging.critical("System is shutting down!")





Log4j2




#What is Log4j?

A Java-based logging utility used to output log messages to various destinations (console, file, database, socket, etc.)
Provides control over what is logged and how it is logged using log levels, loggers, appender, and layouts.
Helps separate diagnostic output from core business logic.




Core Components of Log4j

Component	Description
Logger	        Captures logging information
Appender	Defines where logs are written (file, console, database, etc.)
Layout	        Defines the format of the log message
Level	        Indicates the severity or importance of the message (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, ERROR)



Log Levels in Log4j
Level	Purpose
FATAL	Critical errors causing system shutdown
ERROR	Significant problems, app can still run
WARN	Something unexpected, but not harmful
INFO	General informational messages
DEBUG	Detailed diagnostic info
TRACE	Most detailed information, usually for low-level debugging
OFF	Turns off logging
ALL	Enables all levels of logging



Basic Example: log4j.properties

log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, file
log4j.appender.file=org.apache.log4j.FileAppender
log4j.appender.file.File=app.log
log4j.appender.file.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.file.layout.ConversionPattern=%d [%t] %-5p %c - %m%n




Java Code Example

import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
public class Demo {
    static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(Demo.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        logger.debug("Debugging message");
        logger.info("Informational message");
        logger.warn("Warning message");
        logger.error("Error message");
        logger.fatal("Fatal message");
    }
}


Common Log4j Appenders
Appender	Description
ConsoleAppender	Logs to the console
FileAppender	Logs to a file
RollingFileAppender	Rotates log files based on size/date
SocketAppender	Sends logs over a network socket
JDBCAppender	Writes logs to a database



Log4j Security Note
Log4j 1.x is outdated and no longer maintained.
Log4j 2.x is the recommended version.



Logger Hierarchy in Log4j
In Log4j, loggers are organized in a hierarchical tree structure based on their names,
 which usually represent the package and class names of your application (like com.company.module.ClassName).



Key Concept: Logger Hierarchy
Loggers are named using dot-separated namespaces, and child loggers inherit settings (like level and appenders) from their parent loggers unless explicitly overridden.

Example Logger Tree

Root Logger
 └── com
     └── com.company
         └── com.company.module
             └── com.company.module.ClassName

com.company.module.ClassName is a child of com.company.module, which is a child of com.company, and so on.

All loggers inherit from the Root Logger unless configured otherwise.



Logger Inheritance Behavior
Inheritance	         Behavior
Level Inheritance	If a logger doesn't have its own level, it inherits the level from its parent
Appender Inheritance	If additivity = true (default), log messages are also sent to parent appenders



Additivity
Additivity = true (default): Messages are passed up the hierarchy to parent loggers and their appenders.
Additivity = false: Stops message propagation to ancestors.




Example in log4j.properties

# Root logger
log4j.rootLogger=INFO, console

# Logger for a package
log4j.logger.com.company.module=DEBUG, file
log4j.additivity.com.company.module=false
In this example:

Messages from com.company.module are logged at DEBUG level and go to the file appender only.
Messages from other packages go to console at INFO level.





Code Example

Logger rootLogger = Logger.getRootLogger();
Logger moduleLogger = Logger.getLogger("com.company.module");
Logger classLogger = Logger.getLogger("com.company.module.ClassName");
classLogger.debug("Debug from class"); // Goes to moduleLogger’s config if classLogger has none



Why Logger Hierarchy Is Useful
Fine-grained control: Set different log levels per module/package.
Organized configuration: Follows Java package structure.
Avoid duplication: Use inheritance to avoid repeated configuration.





Lab:
s-1  create a maven project using log4j2 using 
             org.apache.mavenarchetypes:maven-achetypes-quick   dependency

s-2 install  Installing Log4j2

s-3
create a class
import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;

public class App {
    private static final Logger logger = LogManager.getLogger(App.class);
    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        System.out.println( "Hello, user!" );
        logger.trace("We've just greeted the user!");
        logger.debug("We've just greeted the user!");
        logger.info("We've just greeted the user!");
        logger.warn("We've just greeted the user!");
        logger.error("We've just greeted the user!");
        logger.fatal("We've just greeted the user!");
    }
}




s-4 message with default configuration available in the console.


s-5 create custom configuration for log4j2
Log4j2’s custom configuration isn’t enough for most real use cases. After all, you probably want to log to more useful targets than the console. You’ll also want to log using the other logging levels. So, now, we’re going to see how to configure Log4j2 beyond its default configurations.

Log4j2, like many other logging frameworks, can be configured both programmatically but also via configuration files.

//customizing log4j2

- create a directory resources under main.
- under resources create log4j2.xml

#log4j2.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration status="INFO">
    <Appenders>
        <Console name="ConsoleAppender" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
            <PatternLayout pattern="%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n" />
        </Console>
    </Appenders>
    <Loggers>
        <Root level="debug">
            <AppenderRef ref="ConsoleAppender" />
        </Root>
    </Loggers>
</Configuration>

========================================================

Log4J2   and  SLF4J


Introduction to SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java)
SLF4J supports integration with multiple frameworks and libraries making it suitable for normal and flexible projects. LOG4J also supports integration with multiple Java-based frameworks and applications. LOG4J 2's API makes it even more preferable for modern applications requiring advanced logging features.




What is SLF4J?
SLF4J stands for Simple Logging Facade for Java. It is not a logging implementation but a facade or abstraction for various logging frameworks (e.g., Log4j, java.util.logging, Logback). 
It allows developers to write logging code that is independent of the actual logging implementation used at runtime.


Why Use SLF4J?
Decoupling: You can switch between different logging frameworks without changing your application code.
Uniform API: Offers a standard interface that works across different logging backends.

Bridges Available: SLF4J provides bridges to redirect logs from other APIs (like commons-logging, java.util.logging) to SLF4J-supported frameworks like Logback.


Key Concepts
Facade Layer: SLF4J acts as a common API.
Binding: You include a specific backend (e.g., slf4j-log4j12.jar) to bind SLF4J to a concrete implementation.
Backends: Logback, Log4j, java.util.logging, tinylog, etc.


How SLF4J Works
At compile-time:
You write your code using the SLF4J API.


At runtime:
You include the desired logging framework binding (like Logback or Log4j), and SLF4J delegates logging calls to that implementation.


Example Code

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class MyApp {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyApp.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        logger.info("Application started");
        logger.warn("This is a warning");
        logger.error("This is an error message");
    }
}


SLF4J with Logback (Typical Setup)
Dependencies (Maven):


<dependency>
  <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.9</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
  <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.11</version>
</dependency>


SLF4J Logging Levels
TRACE: Fine-grained debugging

DEBUG: Debugging information

INFO: General runtime events

WARN: Potential issues

ERROR: Error events




Benefits of SLF4J
Pluggable backend
Lightweight and flexible
Clean separation of concerns
Industry standard in modern Java development
Let me know if you'd like a comparison between SLF4J and Log4j, or a guide to setting it up in a Maven/Gradle project.

#File management
Listing file command
Metacharacters in unix
Creating Files in Unix




Listing file command:

ls		List files and directories in the current directory
ls -l		Long listing format (includes permissions, owner, size, etc.)
ls -a		Lists all files including hidden files (those starting with .)
ls -la or ls -al	Long listing including hidden files
ls -lh		Long listing with human-readable file sizes (e.g., KB, MB)
ls -lt		Sort by modification time (newest first)
ls -ltr		Sort by modification time (oldest first)
ls -R		Recursively list subdirectories


Metacharacters in unix
metacharacters are special characters that have a meaning beyond their literal value. 
They are used for pattern matching, command chaining, redirection, and more.

	
Wildcard (Globbing) Metacharacters
Metacharacter	Meaning	Example
*	Matches zero or more characters	              ls *.txt (lists all .txt files)
?	Matches exactly one character	              ls file?.txt (matches file1.txt, fileA.txt)
[]	Matches any one character in the se       ls file[123].txt (matches file1.txt, file2.txt, 





Creating Files in Unix


1. touch – Create an Empty File

touch filename.txt
Creates an empty file named filename.txt

If the file already exists, updates its timestamp


2. echo – Create File with Text

echo "Hello, Unix!" > file1.txt

#Directory Management:

1.Home Directory
Your home directory is where you land after logging in.


2. Absolute vs Relative Pathnames
Type	         Example	Description
Absolute	/home/user/docs/file.txt	Full path from the root /
Relative	../docs/file.txt	        Path relative to current directory

Examples:


cd /etc           # absolute
cd ../Downloads   # relative (go up one level, then into Downloads)


3. Listing Directories
Use the ls command:


ls                  # List current directory
ls -l               # Long listing with details
ls -a               # Include hidden files (starting with .)
ls /path/to/dir     # List a specific directory



4. Creating Directories
Use mkdir (make directory):


mkdir myfolder             # Create a single directory
mkdir -p folder1/folder2   # Create nested directories


5. Removing Directories
Use rmdir 


rmdir emptydir             # Remove empty directory



6. Changing Directories
Use cd (change directory):


cd /path/to/directory       # Absolute path
cd myfolder                 # Relative path
cd ..                       # Move up one level
cd ~                        # Go to home directory
cd -                        # Go to previous directory


7. Renaming Directories
Use mv (move):


mv olddirname newdirname

Example:

mv projects backup_projects





















#File Permission/Access Modes

1. Permission Indicators
When you run ls -l, you see lines like this:

-rwx r-x r--  1 user group  1234 Jul 28 14:00 file.sh
The first column (-rwxr-xr--) breaks down as:



Position	Meaning	Who it applies to
-	File type (- for regular file, d for directory)	—
rwx	Read, write, execute	Owner
r-x	Read, execute	                    Group
r--	Read only	                    Others



2. File Access Modes
For files, the meaning of permissions:

Permission	Description
r (read)	View the contents of the file
w (write)	Modify or overwrite the file
x (execute)	Run the file as a program/script



3. Directory Access Modes
For directories, the permission meanings are different:

Permission	Description
r	List files in the directory
w	Create, delete, or rename files in the directory
x	Enter (cd into) and access files inside the directory



4. Changing Permissions – chmod
- These permissions control who can read, write, or execute a file or directory

User Categories:
u: User (owner)
g: Group
o: Others
a: All (u, g, and o)

Permission Types:
r: Read
w: Write
x: Execute

Operators:
+: Add permission
-: Remove permission
=: Set permissions exactly



chmod u+w filename  # Adds write permission for the owner
chmod g-x directory # Removes execute permission for the group
chmod a=rwx file.sh # Sets read, write, and execute permissions for all



chmod u+x file.sh      # Add execute permission to the owner
chmod g-w file.txt     # Remove write permission from group
chmod o=r file.txt     # Set read-only for others
chmod a+x script.sh    # Add execute for all (user, group, others)




5. Absolute (Octal) Permissions
Each permission has a number:

Permission	Value
r	4
w	2
x	1

So:

rwx = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

rw- = 4 + 2 = 6

r-- = 4 = 4

Example:

chmod 755 file.sh

This gives:

7 = rwx (owner)

5 = r-x (group)

5 = r-x (others)

#Process Management

1. Starting a Process
A process is typically started by running a command or executing a script:


./script.sh
python app.py
This starts the process in the foreground by default.


2. Foreground Processes
Takes over the terminal until finished.

You can't use the terminal while it's running.


sleep 30
To stop a foreground process:

Press Ctrl + C → Terminates the process

Press Ctrl + Z → Suspends (pauses) the process and moves it to the background (stopped)



3. Background Processes
Run without blocking the terminal.

Start a process in the background:

sleep 60 &
The & runs the process in the background.

You’ll see output like:


[1] 12345
[1] = Job ID

12345 = Process ID (PID)



4. Listing Running Processes
Use ps:

ps                # Processes in current shell
ps -ef            # All processes with full details
ps aux            # All processes (BSD style)
Use jobs:


jobs              # Shows background/suspended jobs in current terminal
Use top or htop:


top               # Real-time view of system processes

5. Stopping/Killing Processes
Command	Action
kill PID	Gracefully stop a process by ID
kill -9 PID	Forcefully terminate a process
kill %1	Kill job with job ID 1
fg	Bring background job to foreground
bg	Resume suspended job in background


6. Parent and Child Processes
Every process has a parent (except init or systemd).

Use ps -ef or pstree to see hierarchy.

Example:


ps -o pid,ppid,cmd
Column	Description
PID	Process ID
PPID	Parent Process ID
CMD	Command used to start it



7. Daemon Processes
Background services (e.g., cron, sshd)

Started during boot or manually

Run independently of terminal

Check daemons:


ps -ef | grep daemon
Create a simple daemon-like script:


nohup myscript.sh &

8. top Command – Monitor System in Real-Time

top
Shows CPU, memory, and process stats

Press k to kill a process

Press q to quit

Use htop for an interactive version (if installed)



9. Job ID vs Process ID
Term	Description
Job ID (%1)	ID assigned by shell to background/suspended job
Process ID (PID)	Unique OS-level ID for every process

Use jobs to find job ID:

Use ps or top to find PID:


ps -ef | grep process_name

Example: Combined Usage

sleep 100 &
jobs                   # Shows job ID
ps -ef | grep sleep    # Find PID
kill -9 <PID>          # Kill process
Let me know if you'd like:

A visual process hierarchy diagram

Practice exercises on process control

A script to monitor and kill idle processes



#networking command
1. ping – Test Network Connectivity

ping hostname_or_ip
Example:

ping google.com

Key Options:
Option	Description
-c 4	Send only 4 packets
-i 2	Set interval between pings to 2 seconds
-t 5 (Linux)	Set TTL (time to live)
Ctrl + C	Stop ping manually if running continuously

2. ftp – File Transfer Protocol Client
Note: ftp is outdated and insecure. Use sftp or scp if possible.

Usage:
ftp hostname
Interactive Commands:
Command	Description
open hostname	Connect to an FTP server
user	Provide username and password
ls / dir	List remote files
get file.txt	Download file
put file.txt	Upload file
bye or quit	Exit FTP session

Example:

ftp ftp.example.com
3. telnet – Remote Terminal Access
Note: Like ftp, telnet is insecure. Use ssh instead.

Usage:

telnet hostname port
Example:

telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl
Connects to a remote system on a given port

Can be used to test if a port is open (e.g., telnet google.com 80)

Reporting Progress in Agile Projects typically focuses on transparency, collaboration,
 and value delivery over rigid documentation. Instead of traditional progress reports, Agile uses lightweight, iterative techniques. Here's an overview of how progress is reported in Agile projects:


1. Daily Stand-ups (Daily Scrum)
Frequency: Dail
Purpose: Quick updates by each team member:
What was done yesterday?
What will be done today?
Any blockers or impediments?

2. Sprint Reviews
Frequency: At the end of each sprint
Purpose: Demonstrate completed work (potentially shippable product increment) to stakeholders for feedback.
Outcome: Agreement on what’s complete, discussion on next priorities.

3. Burndown Charts / Burnup Charts
Burndown: Tracks remaining work over time.
Burnup: Shows completed work towards total scope.
Benefit: Visual, simple way to track sprint or release progress.

4. Velocity Tracking
Measures the amount of work (usually in story points) completed per sprint.
Helps forecast future sprint capacity and release planning.

5. Cumulative Flow Diagrams
Visualizes the flow of work through stages (To Do, In Progress, Done).
Identifies bottlenecks or work pile-ups.

6. Sprint Goals Achievement
Progress reported against pre-defined sprint goals, not just task completion.

7. Product Backlog Refinement
Continuous visibility of prioritized items.
Reporting can focus on how backlog is evolving based on customer feedback and team capacity.


8. Team Demos
Short demos after completing significant features or increments, outside of formal sprint reviews.


9. Agile Project Dashboards (Tool-Based Reporting)
Tools like Jira, Azure DevOps, Rally, or Trello provide real-time dashboards.
Common metrics:
Number of stories completed
Remaining backlog items
Sprint progress
Team capacity/utilization

   - Staging area - when git start tracking and saving changes 
   - Git Directory - local repo or .git


Remote Repository:
   - code hosting service.


Branch in GIT :
    - git will work as tree. that have multiple branch.
    - each branch have its leaf , fruit etc.
    - fall of any branch will not impact the tree.

/> git branch
   
/> ll

/> git branch develop

develop branch created in the GitHub
each branch have their own specific file system
each branch have their own specific code base
Image

marge the develop branch with master branch
create pull request from develop to master
change from master to develop
code of develop is merged to master branch



- developer create their own branch
- dev have their incomplete code with their end.
- once complete then dev marge the code with the main branch.
- compare git commit
     />git diff
        />git log --oneline
- compare change between 2 commit
        /> git diff 5065aff 5a2d942
- when we create release branch from master branch that branch is fixed.
- image
- branch have your tested code from the team
- every team will create the release branch
- main branch will continue
- using branch git support version control system


HandsOn- Git Marge is working
       - git diff  [commitid]  [commitid]
       - same code in the master branch and develop branch

What is Shell Scripting?

Shell scripting is the process of writing a series of commands in a text file 
(called a script) to be executed by the Unix/Linux shell (such as bash, sh, zsh).
A shell script automates repetitive tasks, system administration jobs, application deployment, and more.


Key Features of Shell Scripting
Feature	Description
Automation	Run a sequence of commands automatically
Simplicity	Easy to write and execute on most Unix/Linux systems
Integration	Works with commands, utilities, and system resources
Portability	Can run on different systems with minimal changes


Common Shells Used
Shell	Description
sh	Bourne Shell (original)
bash	Bourne Again Shell (most common)
zsh	Z Shell (advanced features)
csh	C Shell
ksh	Korn Shell



Basic Shell Script Example

#!/bin/bash

echo "Welcome to Shell Scripting!"
name="Amit"
echo "Hello, $name"
To run:
Save as myscript.sh

Make executable:
chmod +x myscript.sh
Execute:

./myscript.sh



What You Can Do with Shell Scripts
Automate backups
Monitor system health
Process files and logs
Install and configure software
Schedule tasks with cron
Create custom command-line tools



Key Concepts in Shell Scripting
Concept	Example
Variables	name="Amit"
Conditionals	if, else, elif
Loops	for, while, until
Functions	myfunc() { echo "Hi"; }

What is Shell Scripting?

Shell scripting is the process of writing a series of commands in a text file 
(called a script) to be executed by the Unix/Linux shell (such as bash, sh, zsh).

A shell script automates repetitive tasks, system administration jobs, application deployment, and more.

   Hello.js   JS Engine

   Hello.py   PVM

   hello.sh   Unix Shell



















Key Features of Shell Scripting
Feature	Description
Automation	Run a sequence of commands automatically               
Simplicity	Easy to write and execute on most Unix/Linux systems
Integration	Works with commands, utilities, and system resources
Portability	Can run on different systems with minimal changes




















Common Shells Used
Shell	Description
sh	Bourne Shell (original)
bash	Bourne Again Shell (most common)
zsh	Z Shell (advanced features)
csh	C Shell
ksh	Korn Shell























Basic Shell Script Example

#!/bin/bash

echo "Welcome to Shell Scripting!"
name="Amit"
echo "Hello, $name"


To run:
Save as myscript.sh

Make executable:
chmod +x myscript.sh

Execute:
myscript.sh

./myscript.sh   //run a shellscript














What You Can Do with Shell Scripts
Automate backups
Monitor system health
Process files and logs
Install and configure software
Schedule tasks with cron
Create custom command-line tools



















Key Concepts in Shell Scripting

Variables	name="Amit"
Conditionals	if, else, elif
Loops	for, while, until
Functions	myfunc() { echo "Hi"; }
Arguments	$1, $2, ...
Exit status	$? for last command result
























Variable name:
_ALI
TOKEN_A
VAR_1
VAR_2

name="Amit"   //scalar variable

Read-only Variables :
empId=20
readably empId
empId=30

Unsetting Variables:
name="Amit"
unset name
echo $name

Special Variable:     

$echo $$	 //print process id







Command line argument:

echo "File Name: $0"
echo "First Parameter : $1"
echo "Second Parameter : $2"
echo "Quoted Values: $@"
echo "Quoted Values: $*"
echo "Total Number of Parameters : $#"


	
$0   The filename of the current script.	
$n   These variables correspond to the arguments with which a script was invoked.
$#    The number of arguments supplied to a script.
$*  All the arguments are double quoted. If a script receives two arguments, $* is equivalent to $1 $2.
$@   All the arguments are individually double quoted. If a script receives two arguments, $@ is equivalent to $1 $2.
$?  The exit status of the last command executed.
$$  The process number of the current shell. For shell scripts, this is the process ID under which they are executing.
$!  The process number of the last background command.

NAME[3]="Ayan"
NAME[4]="Daisy"
echo "First Index: ${NAME[0]}"
echo "Second Index: ${NAME[1]}"

echo "First Index: ${NAME[*]}"
echo "Second Index: ${NAME[@]}"




Basic Operator:
val=`expr 2 + 2`
echo "Total value : $val"



Control Statement: Iterative

a=0
while [ "$a" -lt 10 ]    # this is loop1
do
   b="$a"
   while [ "$b" -ge 0 ]  # this is loop2
   do
      echo -n "$b "
      b=`expr $b - 1`
   done
   echo
   a=`expr $a + 1`
done

Control Statement: Selection

number=15

# Check if the number is greater than 10

if [ $number -gt 10 ]; then
  echo "The number $number is greater than 10."
else
  echo "The number $number is not greater than 10."
fi

echo "Outside function: Global var = $g_var"
echo "Outside function: Local var = $_var (will be empty)"













#Error Handling:


Error handling in shell scripts ensures that a script can gracefully manage unexpected situations,
such as failed commands, missing files, or invalid inputs.
This prevents script crashes and incorrect results.

Key Techniques for Error Handling:
1. Checking Exit Status:
Every command in a shell returns an exit status code. A value of 0 typically indicates success, while any non-zero value indicates an error. The $? variable holds the exit status of the most recently executed command. 
Code




#!/bin/bash

# Attempt to create a directory
mkdir /tmp/my_new_directory

# Check the exit status of the mkdir command
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error: Failed to create directory /tmp/my_new_directory."
    exit 1 # Exit with an error code
fi

echo "Directory created successfully."






2. set -e (Exit on Error):
The set -e command causes the script to exit immediately if any command fails (returns a non-zero exit status).
Code

#!/bin/bash
set -e # Exit on error

echo "Starting script..."

# This command will likely fail if the directory doesn't exist or permissions are wrong
rmdir /non_existent_directory 

echo "This line will not be executed if rmdir fails."








3. trap Command for Cleanup and Custom Error Handling:
The trap command allows you to execute a command or function when a specific signal or event occurs, including errors (ERR) or script exit (EXIT).
Code

#!/bin/bash

# Define a cleanup function
cleanup() {
    echo "Cleaning up temporary files..."
    rm -f /tmp/temp_file.txt
}

# Register the cleanup function to run on script exit (even if successful)
trap cleanup EXIT

# Register a custom error handler for non-zero exit statuses
trap 'echo "An error occurred! Exiting..."; exit 1' ERR

# Create a temporary file
touch /tmp/temp_file.txt

# Simulate an error (e.g., trying to remove a non-existent directory)
rmdir /non_existent_directory_again

echo "This line will not be reached if an error occurs."



The cleanup function ensures that /tmp/temp_file.txt is removed when the script exits, regardless of success or failure.
The trap ... ERR statement catches any non-zero exit status, prints an error message, and then exits the script with an error code. This provides more controlled error handling than simply relying on set -e

Difference Between CSS and SCSS

CSS is a stylesheet language whereas SCSS is a preprocessor scripting language that is a superset of CSS.

CSS is a stylesheet language for designing the layout of web pages.
It is simple to use and follows a cascading hierarchy to apply styles to HTML elements.

<html>
<head>
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: darkblue;
            text-align: center;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to CSS</h1>
</body>
</html>


SCSS
SCSS (Sassy CSS) is a preprocessor scripting language that extends CSS with features like variables, nesting, and mixins.
It makes stylesheets more maintainable and efficient to write.


Hello.html
<html>
<head>

    <title>Hello</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css"/>
</head>
<body>
     <div class="box">This is an Example of scss</div>   
</body>
</html>


mystyle.css

.box{
    width: 200px;
    height: 300px;
    text-align: center;
    background-color: lightcoral;
    color: white;
}

.box:hover{
    background-color: darkgray;
}



mystyle.scss

$box-color: lightcoral;
$text-color: blue;

.box {
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: $box-color;
    color: $text-color;
    text-align: center;
    line-height: 100px;

    &:hover {
        background-color: darkred;
    }
}

Differences between CSS and SCSS



case-1
Cascading Style Sheet is a stylesheet language used to 
define the presentation and layout of a webpage written in HTML or XML.

Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet SCSS (Sassy CSS) is a preprocessor
 scripting language that is a superset of CSS.

case-2

CSS follows a plain-text syntax
SCSS follows a structured syntax with additional features such as variables, nesting, and mixins.

case-3
CSS uses plain text and keywords for styling
SCSS allows you to define variables to store commonly used values such as colors, font sizes, and spacing

case-4
CSS requires you to write each selector separately.
SCSS allows you to nest selectors within other selectors, making it easier to write and read complex stylesheets,

case-5
CSS does not provide functionality to use Mixins
SCSS allows you to create reusable code snippets using mixins, which are like functions in programming languages.

case-6
CSS files use the .css file extension
SCSS files use the .scss file extension.

case-7
CSS files are interpreted by web browsers directly
SCSS files must be preprocessed into standard CSS files using a preprocessor such as Sass

case-8
CSS Does not use additional features
SCSS contains all the features of CSS and contains more features that are not present in CSS 


Feature	Benefit

Variables		Easily change colors, spacing
Mixins			Reuse styles for components
Custom Themes		Build consistent UI fast
Modular SCSS		Better file organization

//jQuery Fading Methods
With jQuery you can fade an element in and out of visibility.
jQuery has the following fade methods:

fadeIn() - used to fade in a hidden element.
fadeOut() - used to fade out a visible element.
fadeToggle() - toggles between the fadeIn() and fadeOut() methods.
fadeTo() - allows fading to a given opacity (value between 0 and 1)

What is AJAX?, jQuery AJAX Methods, jQuery - AJAX load() Method, jQuery - AJAX get() and post() Methods



What is AJAX?
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.


Why Ajax ?
Read data from a web server - after a web page has loaded
Update a web page without reloading the page
Send data to a web server - in the background

Key Features:
It allows web pages to update asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes.
This means a web page can update parts of the content without reloading the whole page.

Real-world Example:
When you search in Google, suggestions appear as you type – that's AJAX in action.


jQuery AJAX Methods
jQuery provides several easy-to-use AJAX methods, including:

$.load()

$.get()

$.post()

$.ajax()



jQuery - load() Method
.load() loads data from a server and places the returned HTML into the selected element.

Example:

<button id="load-btn">Load Content</button>
<div id="result"></div>

<script>
  $('#load-btn').click(function() {
    $('#result').load('data.html'); // Loads content of data.html into #result
  });
</script>



jQuery - get() Method
$.get() sends a GET request to the server and retrieves data.

Example:

$.get('data.php', { name: 'John' }, function(response) {
  $('#result').html(response);
});


jQuery - post() Method
$.post() sends a POST request to the server.


Example:

$.post('submit.php', { username: 'admin', password: '1234' }, function(response) {
  alert("Server says: " + response);
});


jQuery - ajax() Method (Advanced)
This is the most powerful and customizable method.

$.ajax({
  url: 'submit.php',
  type: 'POST',
  data: { name: 'John' },
  success: function(response) {
    console.log('Success:', response);
  },
  error: function() {
    alert('Something went wrong.');
  }
});



Summary Table
Method		Use Case			Type
$.load()	Load HTML into element		GET
$.get()		Retrieve data (simple)		GET
$.post()	Send data to server		POST
$.ajax()	Fully customizable AJAX call	GET/POST

What is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing? Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism for 
integrating applications. CORS defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one 
domain to interact with resources in a different domain.

#Types Of Machine Learning


		A. Supervised Learning -  we know the input and output



			1.classification -  we devide the data into binary  
                                             0 or 1  , TRUE OR  FALSE
                                         -  based on the past data , we will predict if the person is eligible or not




			2.regression -  based on the info we can predict the price of a flat


                            100000 customer
			
					input                                          output

				outside city , 2yr old, 2nd floor , apartment		50 lakhs
				outside city , 4yr old, 20th floor , apartment		60 lakhs
				inside city , new, 5nd floor , not apartment		1.2 cr




						ML Model 

				outside city , 7yr old, 2nd floor ,not  apartment          ?                    








		B. Unsupervised Learning - we know the input and we don't know the output



			clustering -   based on the customer anual income and spending score 
					we send them email notifications.

 

			association -  based on the customer past buying details , amazon will recommand the
					similar type of product

# Define Gen AI
	-Gen AI is a type of Artificial intelligence that create new content based on what it has learnt 
     from the existing content.
	- AI technology that can produce various types of content.
	- It is a subset of Deep Learning.






#Difference Of Gen AI(Generative)  and  Deep learning(Disciminative)
	-   Gen AI  do create content
	-   Deep learning do  prediction






# Discriminative
# Deep Learning Model :(supervised and unsupervised learning)
	ANN - Artificial Neural Network
	CNN - Convolutional Neural Network
	NLP - (RNN) - Recurrent Neural Network





#Generative AI(Deep Learning Model)

#LLM  and LMM

LLM  -  Large Language Model -  chat GPT 3.5 - free
          - support  input (text)  to output (text)
		https://chat.openai.com/c/704507f0-9cbd-4725-afdb-a5683ad6a771


LMM - Large Multi Model -  Chat GCP 4 - not free
           -  support  input (text, image , audio, video,code)  to output (text, image , audio, video,code)


LAM - Large Action Model - 
           - they are designed to understand what you say and take action with it.

# limitation of RNN - it is very ineffective when the gap between relevant information is very large.
                    - can not prioritize your task
                    - sequential computation inhibits parallelization


#LSTM - Long short-term memory networks
                       - LSTM can selectively remember or forget things that are important and not so important



#limitation with LSTM - when sentences are too long , LSTM also not successful.
                      - sequential computation inhibits parallelization.



#Attention 
	- It is used to pay attention to specific words.
	- Attention can be thought of as a mechanism that weights the importance of different inputs when producing an output.


#Self Attention :
	- By applying self-attention, the transformer model can capture the dependencies between different words 
	in the input sequence and learn to focus on the most relevant words for each position.
       

#Transformer -  
         - Transformer   resolve the problem of parallelization using encoder and decoder.

# Creational Design pattern :
		-   It deals with the process of creation of an object.
		-   your object may need to complete multiple steps like it may need to communicate 
			with other object , it may need to connect with some file or url.

		Ex :  Singleton
#Singleton:
              -  A singleton class   have only one instance and accissible through a single point.(method/field)
              -  This pattern solve to ensure that there is only a single instance of the class exist.
              - any state you add to the singleton considered as global state.

part-1  

      public class Singleton {

	private static Singleton obj;
	
	//private constructor
	private Singleton() {
		System.out.println("default constructor called");
	}
	
	public static Singleton  getInstance() {
		if(obj==null)
			obj =new Singleton();
		return obj;
	}
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		Object  obj =Singleton.getInstance();  //lazy initialization
		System.out.println(obj);
		
		Object  obj1 =Singleton.getInstance();
		System.out.println(obj1);
	}
}



limitation :  the above program is not thread safe.


part-2
public class Singleton {
	
	private static Singleton obj;
	
	//private constructor
	private Singleton() {
		System.out.println("default constructor called");
	}
	
	//only one thread can  execute at a time
	public static synchronized Singleton  getInstance() {
		if(obj==null)
			obj =new Singleton();
		return obj;
		
	}
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		Object  obj =Singleton.getInstance();  //lazy initialization
		System.out.println(obj);
		
		Object  obj1 =Singleton.getInstance();
		System.out.println(obj1);
		
	}
}

limitation -   Using  synchronized  main disadvantage is every time while creating this 
	single ton object is expensive amd may decrease performance.


part-3
public class Singleton {
	
	private static Singleton obj = new  Singleton();
	
	//private constructor
	private Singleton() {
		System.out.println("default constructor called");
	}
	public static  Singleton  getInstance() {
		return obj;
	}
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		Object  obj =Singleton.getInstance();  //lazy initialization
		System.out.println(obj);
		
		Object  obj1 =Singleton.getInstance();
		System.out.println(obj1);	
	}
}

 -  we should use this approach when your single ton class is light.



part-4

//double check lock
public class Singleton {
	private static  volatile Singleton obj = null;
	// private constructor
	private Singleton() {
		System.out.println("default constructor called");
	}
	public static Singleton getInstance() {
		if (obj == null) {

			// to make it thread safe
			synchronized (Singleton.class) {
				if (obj == null)
					obj = new Singleton();
			}

		}
		return obj;
	}
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		Object obj = Singleton.getInstance(); // lazy initialization
		System.out.println(obj);

		Object obj1 = Singleton.getInstance();
		System.out.println(obj1);
	}
}

-   this method drastically reduce the overhead of calling the  synchronized method every time.

    private static final Runtime currentRuntime = new Runtime();

Structural Design Pattern: Proxy
Proxy Pattern implemented Using java class
Example from Java API
Limitation Of  Proxy



	

#Structural Design Pattern: 

	- How classes and object are arranged and composed to resolve customer requirements.
	- We can use compostion and inheritance and we can get structural pattern from our classess abd object.


	Example :  Proxy



# proxy pattern
	-  we need to provide  a place holder or surrogate to another object.
	-  proxy act on behalf of other object and is used for some reason


	       A.  Protection Proxy - control access to original object operation
	       B.  Remote proxy -  provide one type of local representation of the remote object
	       C.  Virtual Proxy - delay construction of until absolute necessary
  



#Implemenation of proxy using simple java class (Protection Proxy)

- WebServer.java (interface)
- RealWebServer.java
- ProxyServer.java

- RealServer   and ProxyServer   must implement an interface

public interface WebServer {
	void makeRequest(String url);
}


public class RealWebServer implements WebServer{
	@Override
	public void makeRequest(String url) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub	
	}
}


public class ProxyServer implements WebServer {
	
	private RealWebServer  realServer;
	private  List<String>  blockedSites = new ArrayList<>();
	ProxyServer(){
		this.realServer=new RealWebServer();
	}
	public void blockWebsite(String url) {
	     	this.blockedSites.add(url);
	}
	@Override
	public void makeRequest(String url) {
		
		if(!blockedSites.contains(url)) {
			this.realServer.makeRequest(url);
		}
		else {
			System.out.println("Website is blocked , please contact your admin");
		}	
	}
}


public class Client {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		WebServer  server= new  ProxyServer();

		((ProxyServer) server).blockWebsite("www.facebook.com");

		server.makeRequest("www.facebook.com");
	}
}





#Real life Example of Proxy

- hibernate and Spring AOP both can cretate proxy for classess which do not create any interface.
- hibernate and Spring AOP use third party framework (cglib,Aspectj) to create dynamic proxy.

 static proxy - implemeted at code at writing , compiling and loadtime.
 dynamic proxy  - implemented during runtime


#Collection Framework

Behavioral Design Pattern: Observer
Realworld Example of Observer Design pattern
Limitation Of Observer Design Pattern



Behavioral Design pattern 
                                 - it descrive how classess and object will interact with each other.
	              Ex. Observer Design pattern





Observer Design pattern Example:

public interface Observer {
    public void notification(String handle, String tweet);

}

public interface Subject {
    public void addSubscriber(Observer observer);
    public void removeSubscriber(Observer observer);
    public void notifySubscribers(String tweet);

}



public class YTTechnicalExpert implements Subject {
	
    protected List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<Observer>();
    protected String name;
    protected String handle;

    public YTTechnicalExpert(String name, String handle) {
        super();

        this.name = name;

        this.handle = "#" + handle;

    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;

    }

    public void setName(String name) {

    }

    public String getHandle() {

        return handle;

    }

    public void tweet(String tweet) {
        System.out.printf("\nName: %s, Tweet: %s\n", name, tweet);

        notifySubscribers(tweet);
    }

    public synchronized void addSubscriber(Observer observer) {

        observers.add(observer);
    }
    public synchronized void removeSubscriber(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);

    }

    public void notifySubscribers(String tweet) {

        observers.forEach(observer -> observer.notification(handle, tweet));

    }
}


public class Follower implements Observer {
    protected String name;
    public Follower(String name) {
        super();
        this.name = name;

    }
    public void notification(String handle, String tweet) {
        System.out.printf("'%s' received notification from Handle: '%s', Tweet: '%s'\n", name, handle, tweet);

    }
}

//Advanced Java Application:
	=> Banking Application 

		1st release
			Saving Account

		2nd release 
			Current Account
			Business Account
			Personal Account
			
	 How will you handle this situation where you are focussed on a specific case 
	 But you have plan to release  new version in the future ?

                   - you can have multiple implementation of a given type and at runtime we can choose 
	the exact implementation class based on the input.

 
Creational Design Pattern: Simple factory

#Simple factory:
	- Multiple types can be implemented and the choice is based on criteria.
	- we simply put the instantiation logic to a seperate class and most commonly 
	to a static method of a class.
	

#Simple factory using Java Class:


	 Post

	      BlogPost
	      NewsPost
	      ProductPost


public abstract class Post {
	private long id;
	private String title;
	private String content;
	//
}

public class NewsPost extends Post{

	private String newsHeadLine;
	//
}

class  BlogPost  extends Post{
	private String author;
	//
}
class  ProductPost extends Post{
	private String prodName;
	//

}


public class PostFactory {
	
	public static Post createPost(String type) {
		switch(type) {
		case "blog":
			return new BlogPost();
		case "news":
			return new NewsPost();
		case "product":
			return new ProductPost();
		default:
			throw new IllegalArgumentException("post type is unknown");
		}
		
	}
}

public class Client {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Post post = PostFactory.createPost("blog");
		System.out.println(post);
		
		Post post1 = PostFactory.createPost("news");
		System.out.println(post1);
	}
}

#Example Of Simple factory from JAVA API

java.text.NumberFormat



#Limitation of Simple Factory:
	- the criteria used by simple factory to decide which object to instantiate  can get more complex overtime.
                  - if you find in such situation the use factory method.



# Simple Factory    and Factory Method
 Simple Factory
- simply we move our instanciation logic from client code
Factory Method
- it is more useful  when you want to deligate object creation in the sub class.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced Java Application : 
Creational Design Pattern: factory method
Example from Java API
Limitation Of  factory method


#factory method
 - we want to move object creation logic from our code to a seperate class.
- we use this pattern when we do not know in advance which class we may need 
   to instanciate
- we let sub class decide which object to instanciate by overriding a factory method.

#Factory method from java  api

java.util.Collection / java.util.AbstractCollection


Limitation :
- more complex to implement becoz more classess are involved.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Simple factory         and      Factory   Method    and  Abstract Factory 
 
Simple factory  
- just one implementation with no sub classing

 Factory   Method
- you have some generic processing (sub classing)

 Abstract Factory 
- we create family of object of same kind

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advanced Java Application : 
Structural Design Pattern: Adapter
Example from Java API
Limitation Of  Adapter

# Adapter
- using  adapter two incompatible interface will communicate with each other.
- In adapter we have an existing object which provide the functionality that client need.
   but the client code can not use the object because it expect the object with different interface.
- we make the existing object work with client by adpting the object to client expected interface.

Advanced Java Application : 
Structural Design Pattern: facade
Example from Java API
Limitation Of  facade

#facade
-A facade encapsulates a complex subsystem behind a simple interface. 
-It hides much of the complexity and makes the subsystem easy to use.


#Facade
-Client has to interact with large number of interface and classes in a sub system to get the result.
-So client get tightly coupled with those interface and classes.
Facade solve those problems.	
Facade provide a simple and unified interface  to a sub system. client will interact with the façade  now to get the same result.



#Java code implementation

Sprint1 - Data Modelling/DAO typically refers to the first sprint in a software development project where the focus is on designing the data model and implementing the DAO (Data Access Object) layer. Here's a breakdown of what each part means:


Data Modelling
This is the process of defining how data is structured and related in your application. It involves:

Identifying entities (e.g., User, Product, Order)
Defining attributes for each entity (e.g., User has name, email)
Establishing relationships (e.g., One User can have many Orders)
Creating ER diagrams or schema definitions
Mapping to database tables (for relational databases) or collections (for NoSQL)
This step ensures that the application has a solid foundation for storing and retrieving data efficiently.

DAO (Data Access Object) Layer
The DAO pattern is a design pattern used to abstract and encapsulate all interactions with the data source (like a database). It provides a clean separation between business logic and data access logic.


Key Features of DAO:
Encapsulation: All database operations are centralized in DAO classes.
CRUD Operations: DAO typically provides methods like create(), read(), update(), and delete() 
Abstraction: The rest of the application doesn't need to know how data is stored or retrieved.
Maintainability: Changes to the database or queries only affect the DAO layer.
Testability: Easier to mock DAO methods for unit testing.

Common DAO Components:
DAO Interface: Defines the standard methods for data access.
DAO Implementation: Contains the actual logic to interact with the database.
Entity/Model Classes: Represent the data structure.
Data Source: Manages database connections.
Transfer Objects (DTOs): Used to carry data between layers.


Sprint1 Context
In Sprint1, the team usually
Finalizes the data model based on business requirements.
Sets up the database schema.
Implements DAO interfaces and classes for core entities.
Ensures basic CRUD operations are working.
Prepares the foundation for service and controller layers in future

How to Employ UML in Agile – Best Practices




What is UML?
UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a standardized visual modeling language used to describe, design, and document software systems. 
It provides a set of diagrams and notations to represent the structure, behavior, and interactions of system components.


Purpose of UML in Software Development

Purpose				Explanation
1. Visualize System Design		UML helps teams visualize the architecture and components of a system before coding starts.

2. Standardize Communication	UML diagrams provide a common language for developers, testers, business analysts, 
                                			and stakeholders.

3. Analyze Requirements	        	It enables clear modeling of functional and non-functional requirements through 
                                 			use case diagrams.

4. Design Software Components	UML supports object-oriented design, helping in creating maintainable and reusable systems.

5. Guide Implementation	        	UML diagrams act as a blueprint that guides developers during implementation.

6. Support Documentation		UML diagrams are excellent for creating detailed technical documentation for current
                                			and future teams.

7. Enable Better Testing and Maintenance	Helps QA and maintenance teams understand how modules interact,
                                               			 what to test, and where bugs may occur.













Benefits of Using UML

Improved Communication  -	Makes it easy for both technical and non-technical team members to understand 
                                		system behavior and design.

Better Planning	        -       Early visualization helps identify design flaws, dependencies, or missing requirements.

Faster Development      -	Well-defined models reduce ambiguity and make coding more efficient.

Reduced Risk            -	Early modeling highlights integration issues and logic gaps before implementation.

Facilitates Reusability	-       Object-oriented modeling promotes reusable design patterns and modules.

Easier Maintenance      -	A documented system is easier to understand, debug, and update.





Comparison : Structure vs Behavior vs Interaction Diagrams

UML diagrams are broadly categorized into three types:

Category	 	Purpose
Structure Diagrams	Show the static structure of a system – its components and their relationships.
                        		Ex.Class Diagram -Models classes and relationships
                                             	components-Class, attribute, method, association

Behavior Diagrams	Show the dynamic behavior of the system – how the system changes over time.
                        		Ex. Use Case Diagram -Shows system functionality from user’s perspective
                                             	components -Actor, use case, association


Interaction Diagrams	A subset of behavior diagrams that focus on object interactions – 
                        		how entities communicate and collaborate in processes.
                        		Ex.Interaction Overview -Diagram Combines sequence & activity diagram elements
                     	                      components-Interaction, activity, decision



Common UML Diagrams and Their Uses
Diagram Type			Purpose
Use Case Diagram	       		 Shows user interactions with the system – helps gather requirements.
Class Diagram			Describes the structure of the system with classes, attributes, methods, and relationships.
Sequence Diagram	        		Models the flow of messages between objects in a specific interaction.
Activity Diagram	       		 Shows workflow or processes – useful for business logic and operations.
State Diagram	              		  Represents state transitions of objects – useful for event-driven systems.
Component Diagram	        	Shows the physical components and how they interact – useful in large applications.
Deployment Diagram	        	Represents the deployment of components on hardware nodes – used in architecture design.






Why Use UML in Agile?

Agile Principle			UML’s Role

Face-to-face conversation	   UML provides a visual aid during team discussions.
Customer collaboration	        Use case diagrams help capture requirements with stakeholders.
Responding to change	        Models can be updated quickly with minimal effort.
Working software	                           UML helps design just enough architecture for rapid development.




How to Employ UML in Agile – Best Practices

UML Diagrams for Agile – By Stage
Agile Stage	                                			UML Diagram	         	Purpose

Requirement Gathering (Backlog Grooming)		Use Case Diagram	 	Capture user goals and system 
										interactions clearly.
Sprint Planning	                                			Activity Diagram	 	Model workflows and user stories 
										step-by-step.
Design						Class Diagram, Component Diagram   Define structure and responsibilities
										   of system modules.
Development (During Sprint)	                		Sequence Diagram, 
						State Machine Diagram	         Design interactions and object 
										state behavior.
Testing & QA					Activity Diagram, Sequence Diagram	Visualize test scenarios,
                                                                                						 business rules, and flows.
Deployment & Architecture	                		Deployment Diagram	         Model cloud/on-premise deployment setup.

Understanding and applying the SOLID principles and 
the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle significantly improves Java code maintainability, scalability, and reusability. 



What is SOLID?
SOLID is an acronym for five design principles in object-oriented programming:

S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself















1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change.

##Bad Example:
class UserService {
    public void registerUser(String email) {
        // logic to register user
    }

    public void sendWelcomeEmail(String email) {
        // logic to send email
    }
}


##Good Example (SRP Applied):

class UserService {
    public void registerUser(String email) {
        // logic to register user
    }
}
class EmailService {
    public void sendWelcomeEmail(String email) {
        // logic to send email
    }
}
Now UserService is responsible only for user registration, and EmailService handles emails.







2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.


##Bad Example:
class PaymentProcessor {
    public void process(String type) {
        if (type.equals("creditcard")) {
            // credit card logic
        } else if (type.equals("paypal")) {
            // PayPal logic
        }
    }
}

##Good Example (OCP Applied):

interface Payment {
    void pay();
}

class CreditCardPayment implements Payment {
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Paid with credit card");
    }
}

class PayPalPayment implements Payment {
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Paid with PayPal");
    }
}

class PaymentProcessor {
    public void process(Payment payment) {
        payment.pay();
    }
}
You can add new payment types without changing PaymentProcessor.









3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

- Child classes should never break the parent class' type definitions. 
According to this principle, a subclass should override the parent class's methods in a way that does
 not break functionality from a client's point of view




Bad Example:
class Bird {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Flying");
    }
}

class Ostrich extends Bird {
    public void fly() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Ostriches can't fly");
    }
}



#Good Example (LSP Applied):

interface Bird {
    void eat();
}

interface FlyingBird extends Bird {
    void fly();
}

class Parrot implements FlyingBird {
    public void fly() { System.out.println("Parrot flying"); }
    public void eat() { System.out.println("Parrot eating"); }
}

class Ostrich implements Bird {
    public void eat() { System.out.println("Ostrich eating"); }
}













4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

Bad Example:
interface Worker {
    void work();
    void eat();
}

class Robot implements Worker {
    public void work() { }
    public void eat() { } // not applicable for robot
}



Good Example (ISP Applied):
interface Workable {
    void work();
}

interface Eatable {
    void eat();
}

class Human implements Workable, Eatable {
    public void work() { }
    public void eat() { }
}

class Robot implements Workable {
    public void work() { }
}
























5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.




Bad Example:
class MySQLDatabase {
    public void connect() {
        System.out.println("Connected to MySQL");
    }
}

class oRACLEDatabase {
    public void connect() {
        System.out.println("Connected to oRACLE");
    }
}
class db2Database {
    public void connect() {
        System.out.println("Connected to MySQL");
    }
}



class Application {
    MySQLDatabase db = new MySQLDatabase();
    public void start() {
        db.connect();
    }
}

Good Example (DIP Applied):

interface Database {
    void connect();
}

class MySQLDatabase implements Database {
    public void connect() {
        System.out.println("Connected to MySQL");
    }
}


class Application {
    private Database db;

    public Application(Database db) {
        this.db = db;
    }

    public void start() {
        db.connect();
    }
}
Now we can inject any Database implementation, such as PostgresDatabase, into the application.







DRY Principle – Don't Repeat Yourself
Avoid duplicating logic or data. Reuse code with methods, classes, and inheritance/composition.

#Bad Example (Duplicate Code):

class Invoice {
    public double calculateTotal(double price, int qty) {
        return price * qty + price * qty * 0.18;
    }

    public double calculateDiscount(double price, int qty) {
        double total = price * qty + price * qty * 0.18;
        return total - 100;
    }
}

#Good Example (DRY Applied):

class Invoice {
    public double calculateTotal(double price, int qty) {
        return getPriceWithGST(price, qty);
    }

    public double calculateDiscount(double price, int qty) {
        return getPriceWithGST(price, qty) - 100;
    }

    private double getPriceWithGST(double price, int qty) {
        return price * qty * 1.18;
    }
}
Now we avoid repetition and improve maintainability.


Principle	Focus						Benefit
SRP		One responsibility per class			Easier to test and modify
OCP		Extend without modifying existing code		Flexible design
LSP		Subclass should be replaceable			Avoids unexpected behavior
ISP		Keep interfaces lean				Fewer changes ripple through code
DIP		Depend on abstractions				Easier to scale and test
DRY		Avoid duplicate code				Reduces bugs and effort

Test Driven Development (TDD) Examples
Three Phases of Test Driven Development
How TDD fits into Agile development?
Benefits of Test Driven Development (TDD)
Frameworks for Test Driven Development


#Traditional Approach

1. create class
 class Employee{
     //

    // Employee getUserById(){

     }

 }
2.create testcase
 Class EmployeeTest{

     Employee getUserByIdTest(){

     }

 }

#TDD

1.create testcase  so that the function fail the test

2.create  class 

3.refractor the class so that the function pass the test

































//What is Test Driven Development (TDD)?
Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice that focuses on creating 
unit test cases before developing the actual code. 

The TDD approach originates from the Agile manifesto principles and Extreme programming.
As the name suggests, the test process drives software development.

Moreover, it’s a structuring practice that enables developers and testers to obtain 
optimized code that proves resilient in the long term.

In TDD, developers create small test cases for every feature based on their initial understanding.


//Test Driven Development (TDD) Examples
    Calculator Function: When building a calculator function, a TDD approach would involve writing a test case for the “add” function and then writing the code for the process to pass that test. Once the “add” function is working correctly, additional test cases would be written for other functions such as “subtract”,  “multiply” and “divide”.
 
   User Authentication: When building a user authentication system, a TDD approach would involve writing a test case for the user login functionality and then writing the code for the login process to pass that test.Once the login functionality works correctly, additional test cases will be written for registration,  password reset, and account verification.
  
  E-commerce Website: When building an e-commerce website, a TDD approach would involve writing test cases for various features such as product listings, shopping cart functionality, and checkout process. 
     Tests would be written to ensure the system works correctly at each process stage, from adding items to the cart to completing the purchase.







#TDD Phases:How to perform TDD Test
Following steps define how to perform TDD test,

    Add a test.
    Run all tests and see if any new test fails.
    Write some code.
    Run tests and Refactor code.
    Repeat.

 


























#Benefits of Test Driven Development (TDD)

    -Fosters the creation of optimized code.
    -It helps developers better analyze and understand client requirements and request 
		clarity when not adequately defined.
    -Adding and testing new functionalities become much easier in the latter stages of development.
    -Test coverage under TDD is much higher compared to conventional development models.
		 The TDD focuses on creating tests for each functionality right from the beginning.
    -It enhances the productivity of the developer and leads to the development of a codebase that is
		 flexible and easy to maintain.






#Frameworks for Test Driven Development

	Based on unique programming languages, multiple frameworks support test driven development. 
	Listed below are a few popular ones.
    	-csUnit and NUnit are open source unit testing frameworks for .NET projects.
    	-PyUnit and DocTest: Popular Unit testing framework for Python.
    	-Junit: Widely used unit testing tool for Java
    	-TestNG: Another popular Java testing framework. This framework overcomes the limitations of Junit.
    	-Rspec: A testing framework for Ruby projects


#TDD:
The name itself suggest that first we need to write our test case,
then based on test case we have to provide actual business implementations.

#why we need to write test case first ? 
- using TDD we can maintain 
   		A. code quality
    		B. code coverage
- TDD have its own life cycle

        
         RED    		 GREEN     		  REFACTOR
         failure test case     pass test case           provide the implementation


RED  - what is the possible solution to break my code.
GREEN - write enough code to pass the test case.
REFACTOR - inprove the code without changing its behavior



















#LAB 1

TDD, JUnit, and Mockito — along with simple Java code examples — to help you understand how to test effectively using Test-Driven Development.


What is Mockito?

Mockito is a mocking framework for Java that allows you to simulate (mock) dependencies in unit tests.
Useful for isolating components in tests
Avoids hitting actual database, web service, or third-party APIs



Setup:
1.Junit 5 dependency + Mockito dependency 

Example: JUnit + Mockito

We have a UserService that fetches user data from a UserRepository.
We’ll mock the repository so our tests don’t depend on a real database.

1. Maven Dependencies
Add these to your pom.xml:

<dependencies>
    <!-- JUnit 5 -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
        <version>5.10.2</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Mockito -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
        <artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>
        <version>5.11.0</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Mockito JUnit Integration -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
        <artifactId>mockito-junit-jupiter</artifactId>
        <version>5.11.0</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>



2. Code to Test

User.java
public class User {
    private int id;
    private String name;

    public User(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getId() { return id; }
    public String getName() { return name; }
}


UserRepository.java

public interface UserRepository {
    User findById(int id);
}


UserService.java
public class UserService {

    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public String getUserName(int id) {
        User user = userRepository.findById(id);
        if (user != null) {
            return user.getName();
        }
        return "Unknown User";
    }
}


3. Unit Test with JUnit + Mockito

UserServiceTest.java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith;
import org.mockito.InjectMocks;
import org.mockito.Mock;
import org.mockito.junit.jupiter.MockitoExtension;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;


@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class) // Enables Mockito for JUnit 5
public class UserServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private UserRepository userRepository; // Mocked dependency

    @InjectMocks
    private UserService userService; // Class under test

    @Test
    void testGetUserName_UserExists() {
        // Arrange
        User mockUser = new User(1, "Alice");
        when(userRepository.findById(1)).thenReturn(mockUser);

        // Act
        String result = userService.getUserName(1);

        // Assert
        assertEquals("Alice", result);
        verify(userRepository, times(1)).findById(1); // Ensure method was called
    }

    @Test
    void testGetUserName_UserNotFound() {
        // Arrange
        when(userRepository.findById(2)).thenReturn(null);

        // Act
        String result = userService.getUserName(2);

        // Assert
        assertEquals("Unknown User", result);
        verify(userRepository, times(1)).findById(2);
    }
}


How It Works
@Mock creates a fake UserRepository.
@InjectMocks injects the mock into UserService.
when(...).thenReturn(...) defines mock behavior.
verify(...) checks if the method was called as expected.
No real DB calls happen — tests are isolated.

Oracle PLSQL:

PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is Oracle Corporation's procedural extension for SQL and the Oracle relational database. It enables users to combine SQL statements with procedural constructs, providing capabilities such as variables, loops, conditional statements, and exception handling. 


Data Types:

Scalar Data Types:
INTEGER: Stores whole numbers within a specified range.
NUMBER: Represents numeric values with optional precision and scale.
VARCHAR2 / CHAR: Used for storing character strings of variable or fixed length, respectively.
BOOLEAN: Holds Boolean values (TRUE, FALSE, or NULL).
DATE / TIMESTAMP: Stores date and time values with optional time zone information.
BINARY_INTEGER: Similar to INTEGER but limited to smaller values.


SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
  f_name  CHAR(15 CHAR);
  l_name   VARCHAR2(15 CHAR);
BEGIN
  f_name := 'Srini  ';
  l_name  := 'Navin  ';
 
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('*' || f_name || '*');
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('*' || l_name || '*');
END;
/



Char					VarChar/VarChar2
It is Static Datatype(i.e Fixed Length)	It is Dynamic Datatype(i.e Variable Length)
It can lead to memory wastage		It manages Memory efficiently

The SET SERVEROUTPUT command specifies whether output from the DBMS_OUTPUT message buffer is redirected to standard output



DECLARE
  n1 PLS_INTEGER := 2147483647;
  n2 INTEGER := 1;
  s NUMBER;
BEGIN
  s := n1 + n2;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('The result is: ' || TO_CHAR(s));
END;
/



Composite Data Types:
%TYPE: This pseudo-type is used to declare variables that have the same data type as a specified database column or variable.
%ROWTYPE: Represents a complete row of data in a table or cursor result set.




#control flow statements

Selection Statement - if else if

Iterative Statement - for , while




PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) provides various control structures that allow developers to control the flow of execution within their code. 

IF-THEN-ELSE Statement:
The IF-THEN-ELSE statement allows developers to execute a block of code conditionally based on a specified condition.
If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the THEN block is executed; otherwise, the code inside the ELSE block is executed.


CASE Statement:
The CASE statement evaluates a set of conditions and executes the corresponding code block based on the first condition that evaluates to true.
It is similar to a switch-case statement in other programming languages.


LOOP Statements:
PL/SQL provides various loop statements such as LOOP, WHILE, and FOR loops to iterate over a block of code until a certain condition is met.
The LOOP statement creates an infinite loop that continues until explicitly terminated using an EXIT statement.
The WHILE loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true.
The FOR loop iterates over a range of values or a collection and executes the loop body for each iteration.

    v_marks NUMBER := 78;
    v_grade CHAR(1);

        ELSE
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Better luck next time.');
    END CASE;

  Project Using Maven -  Code Quality :   PMD

  pmd setup



Code Quality tool: PMD

PMD is a static code analysis tool for Java (and a few other languages) that scans your source code without running it, looking for:

Bad practices (unused variables, empty catch blocks, duplicated code, etc.)
Possible bugs (null pointer risks, misused equals/hashCode, etc.)
Style violations (naming conventions, code complexity, etc.)
Maintainability issues (long methods, deeply nested code, etc.)


How PMD Works
Reads Java source code.
Applies pre-defined rules. 
Generates a report highlighting issues.
You fix the code based on these suggestions.

Maven Setup for PMD
Add PMD to your pom.xml:

<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-pmd-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.21.2</version>
            <configuration>
                <printFailingErrors>true</printFailingErrors>
                <failOnViolation>true</failOnViolation>
            </configuration>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <phase>verify</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>check</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>


mvn pmd:check


public class ExamplePMD {
    public void processData() {
        int temp = 5; // Unused variable (PMD: UnusedLocalVariable)

        try {
            // Some risky code
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Empty catch block (PMD: EmptyCatchBlock)
        }
    }
}
Expected PMD Output
If you run PMD on this code, you might get something like:

[INFO] PMD Failure: ExamplePMD.java:3  UnusedLocalVariable: Avoid unused local variables such as 'temp'.
[INFO] PMD Failure: ExamplePMD.java:6  EmptyCatchBlock: Avoid empty catch blocks; this can hide problems.



#Solution

public class ExamplePMD {
    public void processData() {
        int temp = calculateSomething();
        System.out.println("Value: " + temp);

        try {
            riskyOperation();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    private int calculateSomething() {
        return 5;
    }

    private void riskyOperation() throws Exception {
        throw new Exception("Oops");
    }
}





==================================================================
Code Quality tool:  Check Style

Checkstyle is another static code analysis tool for Java 
-while PMD focuses on finding bugs and bad practices, 
-Checkstyle is mainly about enforcing coding standards and style guidelines.




What Checkstyle Does
Enforces naming conventions (classes, methods, variables).
Checks braces placement and indentation.
Ensures JavaDoc comments are present and formatted.
Limits line length and method length.
Prevents magic numbers.
Ensures code follows Google Style Guide or Sun Code Conventions (or your custom rules).


Maven Setup
Add to your pom.xml:

<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-checkstyle-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.3.1</version>
            <configuration>
                <configLocation>google_checks.xml</configLocation>
                <encoding>UTF-8</encoding>
                <consoleOutput>true</consoleOutput>
                <failsOnError>true</failsOnError>
            </configuration>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <phase>verify</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>check</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>


/> mvn checkstyle:check


public class examplecheckstyle {  // Class name should start with uppercase

    public void process_data(){  // Method name should be lowerCamelCase without underscore
        int VALUE=10;  // Variable should be lowerCamelCase
        System.out.println( "Value: " + VALUE );  // Extra spaces, wrong formatting
    }
}

Possible Checkstyle Output

[ERROR] examplecheckstyle.java:1: Class name 'examplecheckstyle' must start with an uppercase letter. [TypeName]
[ERROR] examplecheckstyle.java:3: Method name 'process_data' must be lowerCamelCase. [MethodName]
[ERROR] examplecheckstyle.java:4: Variable 'VALUE' should be in lowerCamelCase. [LocalVariableName]
[ERROR] examplecheckstyle.java:5: 'System.out.println' has extra space after '(' [WhitespaceAfter]

#Solution
public class ExampleCheckstyle {

    public void processData() {
        int value = 10;
        System.out.println("Value: " + value);
    }
}




Checkstyle = focuses on formatting and naming conventions.
PMD = focuses on code smells and potential bugs.
They are often used together in CI pipelines to ensure code quality and consistency.

#Code Quality Tool : SonarQube

What is SonarQube?
SonarQube is a continuous inspection tool for code quality and security.
It analyzes source code for:
Bugs (code likely to cause errors)
Vulnerabilities (security risks)
Code smells (maintainability issues)
Test coverage (unit test percentage)
Duplications
Complexity (cyclomatic complexity)
Style violations


How It Works
Write Code → Commit to Git.
SonarQube Scanner runs (in CI or locally).
Code is analyzed using a set of rules.
A dashboard shows:
Bugs
Vulnerabilities
Code smells
Coverag
Maintainability rating (A–E)
Security rating (A–E)




Local Setup for Java
1. Install SonarQube
Download from: https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/downloads/

Extract and run:
# Start SonarQube server
./bin/linux-x86-64/sonar.sh start
# or on Windows
bin\windows-x86-64\StartSonar.bat
Open browser: http://localhost:9000
Default login: admin / admin


2. Add Maven Plugin
In your Java project’s pom.xml:

<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.sonarsource.scanner.maven</groupId>
            <artifactId>sonar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.10.0.2594</version>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>

3. Run Analysis

mvn clean verify sonar:sonar \
  -Dsonar.projectKey=MyJavaApp \
  -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000 \
  -Dsonar.login=your_generated_token
Java Example
Bad Code that SonarQube will flag:


public class ExampleSonar {

    public void process() {
        String name = null; // Possible NPE
        System.out.println(name.toLowerCase()); // Bug: NullPointerException risk
    }

    public void duplicateCodeExample() {
        System.out.println("Duplicate Code");
    }

    public void duplicateCodeExample2() {
        System.out.println("Duplicate Code"); // Sonar will flag as duplication
    }
}


What SonarQube Will Show
Bug: "Possible null pointer dereference in process()"
Code Smell: "Duplicated block of code found in 1 other location"
Maintainability Issue: "Consider refactoring to reduce duplication"


#Solution
public class ExampleSonar {

    public void process() {
        String name = getNameSafely();
        System.out.println(name.toLowerCase());
    }

    private String getNameSafely() {
        return "Default Name";
    }

    public void printMessage() {
        System.out.println("Duplicate Code");
    }
}


Why SonarQube is Powerful
Continuous monitoring — runs in CI/CD.
Custom rules — you can enforce your own standards.
Quality Gates — block merges if the code doesn’t meet requirements.
Trend tracking — see code quality over time.

#Code Quality Tool : JaCoCo





What is JaCoCo?
JaCoCo (Java Code Coverage) is a code coverage library for Java.
It measures how much of your code is executed when you run tests — helping you identify untested code.


It’s often used with:
JUnit (for unit tests)
Maven/Gradle (for builds)
SonarQube (to report coverage in dashboards)


What JaCoCo Measures
Line Coverage → % of executed lines.
Branch Coverage → % of decision branches tested (if/else).
Instruction Coverage → low-level JVM instructions executed.
Cyclomatic Complexity → number of possible execution paths.
Missed Classes/Methods → code never touched by tests.



Maven Setup
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
            <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>0.8.11</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>prepare-agent</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
                <execution>
                    <id>report</id>
                    <phase>verify</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>report</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>


Example Java Code
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    public int subtract(int a, int b) {
        return a - b;
    }
    public int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }
}

CalculatorTest.java (JUnit 5)
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
public class CalculatorTest {

    @Test
    public void testAdd() {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        assertEquals(5, calc.add(2, 3));
    }

    @Test
    public void testSubtract() {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        assertEquals(1, calc.subtract(3, 2));
    }
}


Running JaCoCo
mvn clean test
mvn verify


JaCoCo will generate reports in:
target/site/jacoco/index.html
Open this HTML file in a browser — it shows:
Coverage per class/method/line
Highlighted lines covered (green) and missed (red)


Example Output
If we only test add() and subtract():
Line Coverage: ~66% (because multiply() was never tested)
Branch Coverage: N/A for this example (no if/else)
Missed method: multiply(int,int)


Solution:
@Test
public void testMultiply() {
    Calculator calc = new Calculator();
    assertEquals(6, calc.multiply(2, 3));
}


=====================================================================

Code Quality With SpotBugs:

What is SpotBugs?
SpotBugs is a static code analysis tool for Java that scans compiled .class or .jar files 
(not just source code) to find potential bugs.

It’s the successor to FindBugs and can detect:
Possible null pointer dereferences
Infinite recursion / dead code
Misused equals/hashCode
Concurrency problems
Bad practice patterns


How It Works
Compile Java code → .class files.
SpotBugs runs pattern-matching algorithms on bytecode.
It reports bug patterns with descriptions, severity, and location.
Developers fix code before deploying.

Maven Setup
Add to your pom.xml:

<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>com.github.spotbugs</groupId>
            <artifactId>spotbugs-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>4.8.6.3</version>
            <configuration>
                <effort>Max</effort> <!-- More thorough analysis -->
                <threshold>Low</threshold> <!-- Show all issues -->
            </configuration>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <phase>verify</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>check</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>



mvn spotbugs:check


Java Example with a Bug
public class ExampleSpotBugs {

    private String message;

    public ExampleSpotBugs(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }

    public void printMessageLength() {
        // Potential NullPointerException — SpotBugs will catch this
        System.out.println("Length: " + message.length());
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        // Bug: Using '==' instead of .equals() for String comparison
        if (obj instanceof ExampleSpotBugs) {
            return ((ExampleSpotBugs) obj).message == this.message;
        }
        return false;
    }
}


What SpotBugs Will Flag
Example report:

[INFO] ExampleSpotBugs.java: Potential null pointer dereference of message in ExampleSpotBugs.printMessageLength()
[INFO] ExampleSpotBugs.java: String comparison using == in ExampleSpotBugs.equals(Object)


Solution:
public class ExampleSpotBugs {

    private String message;

    public ExampleSpotBugs(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }

    public void printMessageLength() {
        if (message != null) {
            System.out.println("Length: " + message.length());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Message is null");
        }
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (obj instanceof ExampleSpotBugs) {
            return ((ExampleSpotBugs) obj).message != null &&
                   ((ExampleSpotBugs) obj).message.equals(this.message);
        }
        return false;
    }
}



Cursors:

Cursors are used in PL/SQL to retrieve and process multiple rows returned by a SQL query. 
PL/SQL supports both implicit and explicit cursors. 
Implicit cursors are automatically created for SQL statements like SELECT
while explicit cursors are declared explicitly using the CURSOR keyword.


CREATE TABLE employees_demo (
    emp_id     NUMBER,
    emp_name   VARCHAR2(50),
    salary     NUMBER
);

INSERT INTO employees_demo VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000);
INSERT INTO employees_demo VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith', 60000);
INSERT INTO employees_demo VALUES (3, 'Mike Brown', 55000);
COMMIT;


-- PL/SQL block with cursor
DECLARE
    -- 1. Declare the cursor
    CURSOR emp_cursor IS
        SELECT emp_id, emp_name, salary
        FROM employees_demo
        WHERE salary > 52000;

    -- Variables to hold fetched data
    v_id     employees_demo.emp_id%TYPE;
    v_name   employees_demo.emp_name%TYPE;
    v_salary employees_demo.salary%TYPE;
BEGIN
    -- 2. Open the cursor
    OPEN emp_cursor;

    LOOP
        -- 3. Fetch data into variables
        FETCH emp_cursor INTO v_id, v_name, v_salary;

        -- Exit loop when no more rows
        EXIT WHEN emp_cursor%NOTFOUND;

        -- 4. Process the fetched data
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('ID: ' || v_id || ', Name: ' || v_name || ', Salary: ' || v_salary);
    END LOOP;

    -- 5. Close the cursor
    CLOSE emp_cursor;
END;
/




Example: PL/SQL Function


-- Create a function to calculate bonus
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_bonus (

       p_salary NUMBER

) RETURN NUMBER
IS
    v_bonus NUMBER;

BEGIN
    v_bonus := p_salary * 0.10;
    RETURN v_bonus;
END;
/


1. Call from PL/SQL block

DECLARE
    v_salary NUMBER := &enter_your_salary
    v_bonus  NUMBER;
BEGIN
    v_bonus := get_bonus(v_salary);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Salary: ' || v_salary || ', Bonus: ' || v_bonus);
END;
/


HandsOn - Create a  PLSQL Function  to do addition between two number taking input from user.
        - Create a PLSQL block to call the function and print the addition result. 









Triggers:

Triggers are special types of stored procedures that are automatically executed in response to specific events occurring in the database. These events may include INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on tables. Triggers are useful for enforcing data integrity rules and implementing complex business logic.



Example: AFTER UPDATE Trigger

-- 1. Create a sample employee table
CREATE TABLE employees_demo (
    emp_id     NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name   VARCHAR2(50),
    salary     NUMBER
);

INSERT INTO employees_demo VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000);
INSERT INTO employees_demo VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith', 60000);
COMMIT;



-- 2. Create a table to store salary change logs
CREATE TABLE salary_audit (
    emp_id       NUMBER,
    old_salary   NUMBER,
    new_salary   NUMBER,
    changed_on   DATE
);

-- 3. Create the trigger
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_salary_audit
AFTER UPDATE OF salary ON employees_demo
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Insert record into audit table
    INSERT INTO salary_audit (emp_id, old_salary, new_salary, changed_on)
    VALUES (:OLD.emp_id, :OLD.salary, :NEW.salary, SYSDATE);
END;
/


How It Works
The trigger fires AFTER a salary is updated in employees_demo.
:OLD refers to the values before the update.
:NEW refers to the new values after the update.
The trigger inserts a log into salary_audit.



Test the Trigger
UPDATE employees_demo
SET salary = 65000
WHERE emp_id = 2;

SELECT * FROM salary_audit;

Sample Output
EMP_ID | OLD_SALARY | NEW_SALARY | CHANGED_ON
------------------------------------------------
2      | 60000      | 65000      | 11-AUG-25

#Web Application with Servlet (MVC)

#Servlet:(Controller)
	1. It is web component.
        2. defined as    RegisterServlet.java
        3. Servlet work as controller inside web application.
        4. it is used to handle client request and response.
        5. we don't write any business logic inside a servlet, we always write controller related logic.
        6. Servet always call Model to execute business logic.
        7. servlet-api.jar
        8. servlet.http.*;

Life Cycle: 
        a. init()
        b. service()
        c. destroy()

Servlet Execution Inside container:
        a. Client request came to Web container
        b. Web Container create two object RequestA and ResponseA
        c. RequestA object find the path of Servlet from web.xml
        d. when RequestA find the path of the servlet from web.xml then container start a thread for that client request.
        e. Thread will call  service()
        f. service() will call doGet() or doPost() based on the type of request
        g. output from doget()/doPost() is attached with the response object.
        h. container will use the response object and send it to client.

                             ServletEngine
        RegisterServlet.java =========>     RegisterServlet.class


Java Class(Model)
        1. model contain business logic.
	2. model contain two type of class. A. Service and B. DAO
        3. model is responsible to connect with Database.

html (View)
        1. The UI layer - client is interacting with.
        2. It is implemented with html.
        


Limitation : 
        1. we have to write huge amount of java code using Servlet.
        2. we can not seperate presentation logic and controller logic.




#Web Application with JSP (MVC)

#JSP = Java Server Pages
     1. defined as  Hello.jsp 
     2. we can seperate presentation logic and controller logic.
     3. we don't have to compile
     4. we have to write very less number of java code inside jsp page.


                                  JSP Engine                           ServeltEngine
           RegisterController.jsp  ========>   RegisterController.java  ==========>   RegisterController.class  



Life Cycle: 
        a. jsp-init()
        b. jsp-service()
        c. jsp-destroy()



Limitation :
       1. we don't have single request handler.so we can't implement security(authentication and authorization)
       2. we can not seperate controller logic from presentation logic




MVC Framework :(Single Request Handler Servelt)

	JSF          => 2003       FacesServlet

#Spring:

    //Spring Introduction 

                   1.   It is used to create   Enterprise Level Application

                   2.  Spring  Framework is Light Weight Component     

                   3.  Spring Framework support loosely coupled architecture

		    4.  Different tier will interact with each other using POJO 

			POJO = Bean class =  Plain Old Java Object

#Secondary Type Injection:
- container can inject one class object inside another class.
      - ref inside spring.xml
      - engine instance variable inside Car.java
      - we have to provide getters and setters inside car class.

class  Car{

          Engine engine;

          //getters and setters 


}

class  Engine{

#DAO = Data Access Object
     - we write  CRUD using DAO


#CORE JAVA  DAO

	StudentDAO    =======>    DB
      - we have used driver manager connection
      - developer is responsible for closing and creation of an object.
      - Exception - compiletime exception , runtime exception
  


#Spring DAO 

      - Spring JDBC  --   Database
      - Spring JDBC   use DI.
		- Container create db connection object.
		- Container initialize connection object.
                - Container do autowire for your connection object.
                - No compile time exception . only runtime exception
      

		1. create maven project
		2. create spring.xml
		3. add dependency inside pom.xml
		4. create client.java 



//Oracle XE
User: system
Passowrd : oracle

                5. add oracle db or mysql db dependency in side pom.xml

Spring MVC 
HandsOn:

Project Spring1 Backend


Spring DAO
	Spring Data JPA(Hibernate,EclipseLink)




Spring MVC 
     1. Spring MVC  work above Spring IOC container.
     2. Spring MVC follow front controller design pattern in the presentation tier.
     3. Spring MVC follow  Data Access Object pattern in the integration tier.
     


#MVC  using Servlet : limitation

#MVC  Using JSP : limitation

# J2EE Design Pattern

- Front Controller:
-	As application grow , number of servlet grow to handle the client request.
-	We have to implement Authentication , Authorization and manage view for each servlet.
-	Solution : Centralized Request Handling mechanism.
-	Front Controller will do automatically authentication/authorization/logging and then 
-       Pass the request to the corresponding handler User.


-Data Access Object :
	-It is used to separate low level data access API from high level business service.
                    -Data access from persistence storage.
	-Manipulation of Data.
                    -Decouple persistence storage from your application.


# Spring MVC Life cycle :

  s-1  first request will come to front controller is DispatcherServlet.
  s-2  DispatcherServlet forward the request to Handler Servlet  like LoginController.java
  s-3  LoginController will return  the login status to the DispatcherServlet in the format of String or ModelAndView Object.
  s-4  DispatcherServlet  will take help of ViewResolver to identify the response status from HandlerController.
  s-5  Once DispatcherServlet find the response status from ViewResolver , send the same response to the client.



#LabSetup:

Usecase:  Login

	
		view        		  controller       		 service   	     dao       db

                LoginView.jsp             LoginController.java
    

#Spring MVC project Using Maven(intellij)

Hands On Demo : Spring MVC Login Application

 1. Create maven project using webapp dependency


 2. Add spring mvc  and servlet dependency


<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-webmvc</artifactId>
  <version>4.3.3.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
  <artifactId>servlet-api</artifactId>
  <version>2.5</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>

 3. Create index.jsp  , success.jsp , failure.jsp , LoginPage.jsp inside jsp folder.


//index.jsp
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="ISO-8859-1">
<title>Insert title here</title>
</head>
<body>

       Welcome  to  Spring MVC

       <a href="/login2">login</a>

</body>
</html>


//LoginPage.jsp
<html>
<head>
<title>Insert title here</title>
</head>
<body>
<form method="post" action="/Login">
		UserId : <input type="text" name="userId" /></br>
		UserName : <input type="text" name="userName" /></br>
		<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
	</form>
</body>
</html>



4. Create web.xml file.


<!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC
        "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN"
        "http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd" >
<web-app>
  <welcome-file-list>
    <welcome-file>/WEB-INF/jsp/index.jsp</welcome-file>
  </welcome-file-list>

  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>spring-dispatcher</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet</servlet-class>
    <init-param>
      <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
      <param-value>/WEB-INF/config/spring-dispatcher-servlet.xml</param-value>
    </init-param>
  </servlet>
  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>spring-dispatcher</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>


6. Create spring-dispatcher-servlet.xml inside config directory.

        </property>
    </bean>


</beans>







7. create controller component


@Controller("loginController")
public class LoginController {

    @RequestMapping(value = "/login2", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public ModelAndView loginPageView() {
        ModelAndView obj = new ModelAndView("LoginPage");
        return obj;
    }

    @RequestMapping(value="/Login", method=RequestMethod.POST)
    public ModelAndView loginCheck(HttpServletRequest request) {

        String  userid = request.getParameter("userId");
        String  pass = request.getParameter("pass");

        if(userid.equals("ABC")) {
            ModelAndView  obj=new ModelAndView("success");
            return obj;
        }
        ModelAndView  fobj=new ModelAndView("failure");
        return fobj;
    }

}

//Web Application Architecture


				- Spring Boot is Open source
				- Using SpringBoot we can create Enterprise level Application.
				- Using SpringBoot we can create Micro Service Architecture.



				2004 - Spring Framework  - Rod Johnson
				2006 - Lots of sub projects -
						SpringBoot
						Sring Cloud
						Spring Batch
						Spring Security
						 

//Spring Framework
				- Spring Framework is Open source
				- Using Spring Framework we can create Enterprise level Application.
				- 2004 - Spring Framework  - Rod Johnson
				- Spring initialially under Spring Org
					1.0   - 2004 
					2.0   - 2006
					3.0   - 2009
					4.0   - 2013
					5.0   - 2017
				- 20013/14 - Spring Framework under pivotal
				- available framework adf - oracle product , struts , jsf ...
					
				Spring 4.x    - java 6 , java 7 , java 8
				Spring 5.x    - java 8 , Java 9

				- Dependency Injection
				- Reduce plumbling of code of Spring JDBC , Spring AOP ,
					 Spring Web,Spring ORM
				- Good integration with other popular framework

			




//Spring and Springboot comparison



			//Spring Boot Introduction
			
			- We follow convension above configuration.
			- we get production grade project using https://start.spring.io/
			- Spring Boot  2.x 
			- we can create SpringBoot project 
					Maven Project
					Gradle Project
			- SpringBoot project is always a maven project.
			- SpringBoot project is an Web Application project.
			- By default is interated with Tomcat , jetty 
			- By default support H2 
					-  relational , created uing java , in memory db






//Spring Boot project Setup

			setup case-1
				- IDE - IntelliJ IDE Community Edition
				- create production grade project using https://start.spring.io 
				- import the project using IntelliJ IDE Community Edition


			setup case-2/lab

					spring-tool-suite-4-4.14.1.RELEASE-e4.23.0-win32.win32.x86_64.self-extracting
					sts-4.2.1.RELEASE
				- Crate Spring Boot project
				- Deploy and run Spring Boot project



//SpringBoot project : maven  task

				   - get all the dependency from centralized repository.
				   - server stared
				   - compile the project
			           - package the project as .jar , .war 
				   - deploy the .war file inside the server
				   - stop 
				   - undeploy the .war from the server.		






//SpringBoot RAD Features

			1. auto-configuration

      @SpringBootApplication = @Configuration +@EnableAutoConfiguration +@ComponentScan

			@Component - to find all the classes in the classpath
			@ComponentScan  - enable @Component Scan
			@EnableAutoConfiguration - auto configuration scan the class path , 
					find a library  in the class path then attempt to 
					guess the best configuration for the existing app.


			2. embedded server
			


			3. Bootstrap the application
				- It enable scaning of the config classes

Web Service
            #Distributed Environment Communication
            - RMI - support homogeneous communication not heterohgeneous 
	    - CORBA - support homogeneous communication and heterohgeneous  - implementation cost is high
            - web service - support homogeneous communication and heterohgeneous
            - using web service we expose the function as vendor independent format.
            - 2 type of web service 
			A. SOAP Based
				- xml based 
                                - xml,xslt,xsd,xpath,xquery,...

			B. REST Based WS
                                - Json based

	
Spring DAO    

          - DAO will communicate with Databse using Spring Data JPA
          - Spring DAO:
		Spring JDBC
		Spring Data JPA
          - Spring Data JPA use Hibernate , Eclipse link as JPA Provider
          - Hibernate , Eclipse link providing ORM

ORM 
	- Class name should map Table name
        - class instance var should map column name
        - object should map table row.

WHY  ORM ?
        -  we can make our application Database independent.

		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
			<artifactId>h2</artifactId>
			<scope>runtime</scope>
		</dependency>
		



B. create application.yml inside resources

server:
  port: 8081
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
    driverClassName: org.h2.Driver
    username: sa
    password: ''
  h2:
    console:
      enabled: true
  jpa:
    database-platform: org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
    show-sql: true



              http://localhost:8081/h2-console


              lab- 5 mins
				




ORM:                            using ORM
      Java Class(Restaurant) ----------------> Table


        @Entity
        Restaurant ----------------------> TableName

        @Id
	restId  ------------------------> ColumnName
     




c. Create Entity

@Entity
public class Restaurant  {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    @Column(name="rest_id")
    private Long restId;

    private String name;

    private String email;

    @Column(name="mobile_number")
    private String mobileNumber;

	//getters setters and constructor

}


- check if entity table created in the table.





				mins - 5 mins












D. create repository

- create package repository
- we should define repository as interface 
- we should use the CRUD method provided by SpringBoot spec




@Repository
public interface RestaurantRepository extends JpaRepository<Restaurant, Long> {

    Optional<Restaurant> findByMobileNumber(String name);

}
















E. create service and serviceimpl


public interface IRestService {

    void createRest(Restaurant restaurant);
    Restaurant fetchRest(String mobileNumber);
    boolean updateRest(Restaurant restaurant);
    boolean deleteRest(String mobileNumber);
}




@Service
public class IRestServiceImpl implements IRestService{

    @Autowired
    RestRepository restaurantRepository;


    @Override
    public void createRest(Restaurant restaurant) {
        restaurantRepository.save(restaurant);
    }


    public Restaurant fetchRestaurant(String mobileNumber) {
        return restaurantRepository.findByMobileNumber(mobileNumber).orElseThrow(
                () -> new ResourceNotFoundException("Restaurant", "mobileNumber", mobileNumber)
        );
    }


    @Override
    public Restaurant fetchRest(String mobileNumber) {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean updateRest(Restaurant restaurant) {
        return false;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean deleteRest(String mobileNumber) {
        return false;
    }
}



F. Create Controller


@org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
@AllArgsConstructor
public class RestController {

    @Autowired
    IRestServiceImpl irestServiceImpl;

    @PostMapping("/create")
    public ResponseEntity<Restaurant> createRestaurant(@RequestBody Restaurant restaurant){
            irestServiceImpl.createRest(restaurant);
            return (ResponseEntity<Restaurant>) ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).body(restaurant);
    }

    @GetMapping("/fetch")
    public ResponseEntity<Restaurant> fetchRestaurantDetails(@RequestParam
                                                                String mobileNumber) {
        Restaurant restaurant = irestServiceImpl.fetchRestaurant(mobileNumber);
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.OK).body(restaurant);
    }

}



			CRUD : CREATE

			http://localhost:8081/api/create

			{
 
			        "name": "a2brestaurant",
				"mobileNumber": "9999999988"
			        
			}














					
###select
					
		
		http://localhost:8081/api/fetch?mobileNumber=9999999943

	

#select		

#Repository

@Repository

	   Optional<Restaurant> findByMobileNumber(String m);
}

public class RestServiceImpl implements RestService {

	
	@Autowired
	RestRepository  restRepository;
	
	public void createRest(Restaurant restaurant) {
		
		restRepository.save(restaurant);
	}

	@Override
	public Restaurant fetchRestaurant(String mobileNumber) {
		
		return restRepository.findByMobileNumber(mobileNumber).orElseThrow(
				()-> new ResourceNotFoundException("Restaurant","mobileNumber",mobileNumber)
		);	
	}
}

#Buzz words About MS


1. Size: Micro service follow fine grained approached based web service.


                                fine grained 
		class Employee{    =================================>   web service

			m1()

			m2()

		}
	
                                coarse grained 
		class Employee{   ==================================>  web service

			m1()

			m2()

			m3()

			m4()

			m5()

		}

2.  Distributed - Using micro service one server can communicate with other server.


3.  DDD -

4.  Autonomy

5.  REST is not the only way   rpc ,grpc , severless

		//Python Introduction:

		       1.  High Level Language.  
				- human Readable 

                                                        2.  Object  Oriented Programming Language

                                 OBJECT :   Any thing that we find in the real life can be defined as object. 
		              Any thing that have attribute and action is defined as Object.
		              tangible and non-tangible

					Attribute                           Action
			penObj                      color , cost , brand            write 

			mobileObj               cost , brand , storage        calling


                                                                                         running  - no 
				         beautiful - no
				         account  - yes ,   non-tangible  
				         order  - yes ,  non-tangible  


                                                          3.   Functional Programming language 


	               4.    Scripting  Language  
				-  does not require the compilation steps.



				//java                compile                    running
				       
                                                                                      hello.java  ------>  hello.class    ------->  NC/MC

				statically typed   (java , .net , c , c++)
					int  a  = 5


				dynamically typed  (JS , python)
					 b  =   30
					 c   =   "Hello"





			         6.    Using python we use very less no of code.

                                                                              till          java 8

					class   Hello{
						public static void main(String args[]){
							int a =5;
							int b = 6;
		                                                                                              System.out.println(a+b);
						}
					}

                                                                            java 9

                                      /> System.out.println("Hello");


				print("Hello")



			          7.   Use of  ;  is optional
				
				//java
				     System.out.println(a+b);

				//python
				    print("Hello!!!!")

                                  Buzz Words About Python :
	
			1.     Simple  To  Use.
				Python is easy to use, powerful, and versatile, making it a great choice for
				 beginners and experts alike. Python's readability makes it a great first
				 programming language — it allows you to think like a programmer and not 
				waste time with confusing syntax.


			2.    Object  Oriented Programming Language
							
                                 OBJECT :  -  Any thing that we find in the real life can be defined as object. 
		             -  Any thing that have attribute and action is defined as Object.
		             -  Tangible and non-tangible

			3.  Dynamically Typed language:
				We don't have to declare the type of variable while assigning a value to 
				a variable in Python.

				statically typed   (java , .net , c , c++)
					int  a = 5

				dynamically typed  (JS , python)
					 b  =   30
